0,Washington,"When Adm. Jackson gave his press conference about Trump's health, Jackson stated that Trump took Ambien (a sleeping pill that can cause irrational behavior) but only for overseas flights, yet oddly, Ambien was *not* included in list of medications in the written medical report issued by the White House. Trump's odd behavior, especially late at night and in early mornings, continues. Now we hear Jackson is suspected of ""overprescription."" Could Jackson be providing Trump with Ambien for *daily* (mis)use?"
1,Washington,But why was this man White House physician to begin with?
2,Washington,"Stop at the second paragraph. He ""drank too much on the job""? ""Too much""?There is no 'drinking on the job' allowed for health care providers. None. Period. Heard of ""AOB""? That is ""Alcohol-on-Breath"". It is grounds for professional discipline, including suspension of one's license to practice."
3,Washington,"This shouldn't surprise anyone, given the over-the-top, very Trumpian, language used by Jackson in reporting on the president's health. Checking your ethics at the door may place you in good graces with Trump, but hopefully sanity will prevail in this instance, and Jackson won't be unleashed on veterans who deserve much better."
4,Washington,"Everyone Trump touches is forever soiled, if they werenât already."
5,Express,"An overweight, out of shape guy in a tiny ""wife-beater"" flag shirt might rise in status if he took care of himself, dressed better, and got an education. I live in a town with people like this. They like to blame others for their lack of good jobs, but they won't go to a vo-tech school or a college, or even graduate from high school, to give themselves a leg up. They think if they sit on their porches and drink Keystone Lite and complain enough, a factory will miraculously open and they'll have a job again."
6,Express,"I am not a social-scientist, but this sounds like a lot of broad generalizations verging into baloney.<br/><br/>White males have been overwhelmingly voting Republican since at least the 1980s, when âLaborâ started peeling away from the Democratic Party, which has relied more and more on voters in urban centers.  Yet these flyover state white men still seem to remain an easy target for the NYT.<br/><br/>As has been much documented and discussed, it was white women who surprised the Clintons and voted overwhelmingly for Trump, not white men.<br/><br/>The Washington Post reported:<br/><br/>âWhile Clinton won women's votes overall, most white women â 52 percent â voted for Trump, according to exit polls. And more than 6 in 10 â 61 â percent of white women without a college degree backed the president.â<br/><br/>But wait, Iâm sure this will get spun that they were coerced by white, Christian males, no?<br/><br/>Frankly, these kind of âgeneralizationâ articles that the NYT publishes from time to time donât add one bit to the political discourse and do seem to affirm Trumpâs callouts of âfake newsâ. <br/><br/>As Ruth Bader Ginsburg stayed, âI am fearful, or suspicious, of generalizations... They cannot guide me reliably in making decisions about particular individuals.â  <br/><br/>Politics is about individuals.  We need to unite to address income inequality, not be divided by race and blame.<br/><br/>Why not write about the real culprit in the election?  The U.S. has an antiquated electoral state system, which undermines our individual votes.  "
7,Express,"I continue to be amazed (and quietly enraged) by the number of people in my life who I had considered to be reasonable and non-bigoted, who in fact detested the fact that a black man was POTUS; just last week, a highly educated and successful business associate confided to me (apparently thinking that I shared his feelings on the matter) how he had ""suffered"" for eight-years under ""that black president"" . . . this mode of thinking is unfathomable to me."
8,Express,This is something i figured out in 2017 after Trump was sworn in. Working around predominantly white males in law enforcement and after many debates with them its all boiled down to a sense of entitlement and holding onto the good old days. When your neighbors your coworkers and the people u watched on television were what? White and male. It was a very sad but sobering experience when my self and my family realized that our neighbors looked at us as if we are a threat to there existence when we wanted a community that worked together for the betterment of everyone. Or so my parents thought when they emigrated to this country working towards the so called âAmerican Dreamâ. NOT
9,Express,"The fear of loss of US global dominance doesn't explain the appeal of ""America first, ignore the rest of the world whenever feasible"" philosophy to Trump voters"
10,Express,There is strong evidence that gender bias played an important role in the election of Trump over Clinton. No woman has ever been elected President.
11,Express,"The study explains quite a lot and none of it is good.  Small wonder that Trump supporters refused to vet him - to look beyond the dog whistles and separate the man from the message.  Their lack of concern for details mirrors his.  After all, it's all about emotions not ideas."
12,Express,"Long suspected, so appreciate the study."
13,Express,"What is lacking in a person's life that they feel a need to dominate others?  Except for the Trump types who inherit wealth, everyone has to make their own way in America.  To feel as if you are a success, trying to hold down other Americans is not going to work so well anymore, as we inevitably must compete globally. This country was founded by stealing the land from Native Americans; since then the country has had a highly competitive culture.  No one is guaranteed anything, as the US has rejected the idea that a society exists to help its members succeed, and they in turn give back something of value to the community. We are hostage to the dog eat dog commercial/business mentality.  There are other values than monetary profit; the country used to know that."
14,Express,"I reject identity politics.  It is short-sighted and wrong to blame the victory of Trump primarily on racist white males.  Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden both agree with me on this. <br/><br/>Yes, race was a factor in the Trump win  But the main cause was the steadily increasing inequality of American life, in which the working class--of all races and ethnicities-has steadily and dramatically losing ground.  People who once lived a middle-class life style are now the working or unemployed poor.  Economic stresses are damaging lives and breaking up families. <br/><br/>Since the time of Bill Clinton and especially since the Citizens United decision, the mainstream Democrats have abandoned their progressivism and cast their lots with the very wealthy--the 0.01 percent.  As long as this situation continues, demagogic, right-wing populists like Trump will find the road to victory open."
15,Express,"Events are often over-determined. It is likely that both economic as  well as status anxiety motivated a fair amount of voters to switch from Obama to Trump, especially in the key industrial states of the upper mid-west.<br/><br/>Look back at the election of 1896.  William Jennings Bryan, a populist, made a strong showing against the winner, conservative William McKinley.  Bryan's support was motivated in part by what historian Richard Hofstadter called ""status anxiety"" among middle-class non-professionals, those who were afraid of losing their social status<br/><br/> A difference between then and now, however, was that the United States was in a great upward swing, economically and politically. It was becoming a world power. Today, there is a broad consensus that the United States is in decline economically and as a world power.  Also, with wages being flat since the 1970s,  many of these people, whose parents voted for FDR, believe that they are slipping out of the middle class.<br/><br/>Thus, both status and economic anxiety contributed to Trumps's unlikely victory."
16,Express,Ironic is voters were worried about losing pecking status in the national world order. Trump has done nothing but undermine that. Also ironic is stating a belief in capitalism then be appall that white privilege is eroded by it. 
17,Express,"shocking<br/>just shocking<br/>i would never have thought of this.<br/>seriously, you'd have to be under a rock and unconscious not to know this<br/>bernie should take note - it's not about their shrinking paychecks<br/>their slogan is more or less make america white again<br/>or make sure my white skin, male gender, and heterosexuality still means privilege for me<br/>Dems should give up on these losers and move on -<br/>get out the vote and build common cause with the face of 21st century America<br/>white men haven't gone Dem in over 50 years - forget them - esp. these causalities of capitalist america "
18,Express,The US until very recently was an overwhelmingly white Christian/Judeo country. No longer. This phenomenon will test the viability of diversity like nothing else could. It may still be morning in America but itâs a different America. 
19,Express,"Call it what you will. The vote for Donald Trump was a vote for White supremacy.<br/>We have seen this view since the end of slavery. After reconstruction was defeated it roared to the  forefront. In the 20's after the 1st World War it generated the KKK with a membership of millions. After the 2nd World War Jim Crow emerged with a vengeance. Deep in the culture of America, White Christians both male and female working and weathy people have harbored an aborant belief and fear that their time is up. Well it may very well be. Good riddance."
20,Express,"It seemed that pretty quickly in, that a very large block of Trump voters were more generally middle class and not in imminent financial risk. (In contrast to those closer to the poverty line-- who as the article suggested-- likely leaned Democrat). <br/><br/>Trump continues to derail any more coherent and organized policy by bids to engage the id of his base. If these voters wish for sound economic policy that could be more directly of benefit to them-- they only have to change their minds and make that communication clear to Trump (through Fox and elsewhere). There is otherwise no 'intervention' those on the left and center can stage to prevent hitting social and economic rock-bottom. "
21,Express,The media is also to blame.  They are stoking the fears of this group.  
22,Express,Yep - well that photo says it all. 
23,Express,Call it what it is- racism.  
24,Express,"Which explains the continued support of Trump even as he does nothing to help them economically. All that matters to them is that he punishes brown people, insults women and reasserts the idea that gay people are a perversion. "
25,Express,Please document how the survey was biased and how the sample size was too small.
26,Express,"Merchant, you finally hit on the cultural difference that I think decided the election: abortion.  There's little chance that the source of Trump's small victory margin in MI, WI and PA wasn't his pledge to appoint a pro-life candidate to the Supreme Court."
27,Express,"Real status or *perceived* status? That's the problem. If Trump voters perceive that he's harming the status of the minorities, the educated elites, and immigrants, then they're fine with that. They'd prefer to be on the top deck of the Titanic, even if it's sinking. <br/><br/>They're not informed or educated enough to understand that this indirectly, but most definitely, undermines them and the economy at large. "
28,Express,Please cite a study that supports your rejection of the article's thesis. We'll wait
29,Express,Best comment on this thread. 100% on point. 
30,Express,"Heritage, the American Enterprise Institute, etc, have all been ""free traders"".  The Fair Trade cause has been led by Senators Sherrod Brown, Elizabeth Dole, Tammy Baldwin and Bernie Sanders. "
31,Express,"According to surveys, Hillary Clinton won the election.<br/><br/>A travel business uses purchased data from Facebook to track behavior.  They then target people who Facebook has suggested as Democrats and tell them that they are more likely to book foreign travel than Republicans.  This feeds into their false belief that they are  superior and encourages them to buy more expensive vacations.<br/><br/>You have been manipulated by an industry that appealed to your worldview that Democrats are the party of the special people.  Democrats are using the same technique to advance their narrative that Democrats are the party of the educated.  Historically, and the election of 2016 is no exception, the more education and the wealthier people are, the more likely they are to vote, and to vote Republican.   There are two exceptions.  PhDs tend to vote Democrat and the 1% tend to spend their money supporting Democrats.  PhDs are inordinately dependent upon government largess for their income and the 1% love the status quo they have purchased from elected and executive branch officials.<br/><br/>The majority of voters with a college degree voted for Trump.  The majority of voters who lack a high school diploma voted for Hillary.<br/><br/>The academics have not in hindsight been able to find any basis for Hillary's assertion that Trump voters are either economic losers or deplorable.  So they are fabricating another explanation to enable Hillary voters to maintain the illusion that they are special."
32,Express,"Wildly left!  Haha.  And there you have it folks.  Our very own Republican lite Hillary Clinton being referred to as Wildly Left.  <br/><br/>Do a little research.  Compared to most all other advanced nations, we are a right-wing corporate nationstate.  Our Democrats are the right wing.  Keep smoking and check your barometer.  "
33,Express,"Dr. Mutz' conclusions are not the ones that are unsupported. Indeed, they are quite thoroughly supported.<br/><br/>You can examine the support at pnas[dot]org.  Search for ""Mutz"" and read the entire study, complete with supporting data and tables."
34,Express,They still vote in greater numbers than other groups.
35,Express,"Evidently, we do.  I have had endless conversations with well-meaning people convinced that if only we went the Hillbilly Elegy route, and understood the ""plight"" of these ""forgotten people"", somehow, the next election will go better.  It will go better if and only if more of those well-meaning people come to vote, and drown out the deplorables."
36,Express,"To be fair, science is at its best when disproving false things.   In this case, the economic-uncertainty trope.  "
37,Express,"Those ""good manufacturing jobs"" are not coming back under Trump, if at all. If and when they do come back, robots will be doing most of the manufacturing work. That's a reality you should get familiar with."
38,Insider,"Love this story, too, and I've always said I would do the same if I ever had a baby out of state.  Texas pride runs deep for its native daughters and sons, even if we're not always sure why or don't agree with the state's trends, politics, or our neighbors.  "
39,Insider,"I absolutely love this story. I wasn't born in Texas, but I spent about a quarter-century there. My wife was born and raised there. Our son was born there. A connection to place is fundamental to who we are. A connection to Texas is braggin' rights. Just ask any Texan (or even some of us would-be's). "
40,Learning,"In all honesty, I do not believe the school I attend is a prime example of a place that encourages self-expression within a studentâs work. Occasionally there may be an instance where our own opinions come into play, but overall is typically disregarded as a way to maintain professionalism. Building the connection between school-life and outside experiences often does not feel like it was thoroughly made. Based on other sources I have also read, it seems that this is actually a common trend among numerous school, not just my own. As frequent as this practice is, it should be much more appreciated. Restraining oneâs voice and personal experiences as a sacrifice for formal sounding academic papers takes away a studentâs chance to liven their writing. While there are circumstances where it is in oneâs best interest to keep âIâ out of their work, this seemingly does not make up for all the other occasions that this personal voice is greatly beneficial in strengthening a piece. Instead of constantly encouraging writers to remain professional, schools should give students a chance to truly display that an actual person wrote their work. "
41,Learning,"One of Mr. Korbâs ideas really resonated with me because he mentioned how teachers teach students to exclude the word âIâ from all of their writing. This specific point really stuck with me because I have been told by many teachers to never use the word âIâ in any form of writing and having that connection with the author right in the beginning resonated with me throughout the essay. Personally, I believe school should be a point of self-expression for everyone because otherwise I think they would be miserable if they had to act a different way to withstand society. I agree that in school it is more difficult to completely self-express yourself because students are not as understanding and judge more often than adults do. I definitely believe that my personality is appreciated in school because we always have the opportunity to share our opinions on different topics through class discussion. The people I feel most comfortable with to express myself is with my friends and family because they know me for who I am and what Iâm like. Overall self expression can depend on the person, some people are timid and do not want to reveal that part of them while others enjoy letting other people know exactly who they are as a person. "
42,Learning,"This doesnât make any any room for self expression or personal work. In Honors classes for instance, analyzing an article is taught step by step specifically using certain words in specific orders and putting the information in a specific sequence. I guess I kinda get what heâs saying about students feeling that they will be valued in school so long as they learn the material given and can easily write about and complete tests on it. However, it seems to me that studentsâ personalities and interests are valued in school as well."
43,Learning,I really agree with this entire article. I don't see school as a place where i can express myself  at all on a personal level. I feel obligated to keep that out unless I'm with friends I wouldn't tell anyone but my best friends or Maybe a teacher that under stands me. My teachers always told me that school is a specific place where students go to school to learn and they go to get an education but sometimes that not true.
44,Learning,"After reading this article, one may say that the idea of school was reconsidered and well-thought of. School is where the majority of kids spend their days. To me, I feel like school is a place for self-expression. I say this because of the different races, culture, and language thats distributed throughout the school. The overall diversity that a school house contains is what makes it full of expression. After reading the article, I can say that I was somewhat able to question and articulate ''devotions, frustrations, little triumphs, and large peculiarities'' because they all deal with self-expression and how I carry myself. I could say that one-fourth of what I care about outside of school does involve inside of school because I tend to lean more on what I know from the outside to learn more about on the inside. All in all, expression and school was rebooted in my mind."
45,Magazine,"I moved my family from the countryside to the city so I could walk or bike to work. Instead of a minimum 20 minute drive that includes a mix of interstate and congested urban roads, It now takes an 8 minute bike ride (or 30 minute walk) on a route that includes an urban park to get to work. I generally only take the car to work when there is inclement weather or when I need the car later in the day to run an errand or go to an appointment later in the day. It was the best move I ever made. Instead of filling up the gas tank twice a week, I usually only need a refill every 10-14 days. Not only am I closer to work, but I'm closer to stores, resturants, and my children's schools and afterschool recreational facilites. I also got to know my neighbors better in a year than I did in the 11 pervious years I lived in the country. If you want to reduce your carbon footprint and save the planet don't buy a house out in the countryside and plant a garden. Move close to work and walk or bike.  Work to make cities more walkable, bikable, and livable rather than building wider roads."
46,Metro,"As 5 year old, I sat on my father's shoulders as we walked among the amazing<br/>World's Fair displays.  I was picked from the visitors to talk on a video phone display at the Bell Telephone exhibit with a visitor at Disney Land.  I remember watching the flickering black and white image on a 4 inch screen on the videophone and being dazzled.  I asked my parents if we could buy one for our home."
47,RealEstate,"The white on white just doesn't do it for me. Definitely a product of doing things in a rush - much easier with one choice. <br/><br/>I'm currently designing an Art Deco bath for my 1935 home, and discovering the way (after 6 tries) a way to arrange the blue tile accents on a white field to bring oddly spaced room together was nothing less than amazing.  If I'd done white on white, I could have not visually tied the offset entry area with the larger space. White on white fails to embrace a space and highlight what is interesting about it. ""Things"" pop, but the space does not. You don't need gobs of color, but enough to take charge and make the space work for you.<br/><br/>Lovely, but not my tastes. "
48,National,"The question is, why would one of the most important leaders in the world protect those who have abused the vulnerable to the point where many may never be able to live normal life, even if the Pope outs their abusers? And not merely protect them, but absolve them of their horrific acts? That puts a bizarre twist to Christ's ""suffer the little children to come unto me"", now, doesn't ?Turn to The Mother Church? The source of their humiliation and pain? Forgive and forget -- unless you are the abused who many never overcome their trauma?"
49,National,"I doubt if most people know you can still own a Thompson machine gun in the U.S. even though it was banned in 1934. But with ownership of such a weapon come some very strict rules. One must pass an intensive background check similar to an FBI background check. It must be registered with the proper authorities and secured to the satisfaction of law enforcement. The cost of such a weapon is also a deterrent. I recently saw one for sale at the price of $20,000.<br/>Since it is highly unlikely Congress will ban the current class of military grade weapons, states could still impose a ban or implement the same measures as applied to the Thompson. We would all be safer for it. "
50,National,Nice uplifting article and a welcomed counter to the endless NRA/weapons manufacturer propaganda which makes it seem like all gun owners are so vociferously against any regulation that each of us is condemned to an endless parade of despair and terror.   Maybe the Times will next do some articles on the countless number of gun shot victims who are condemned to lives of disability.  These forgotten victims are largely swept under the rug during this debate and they far outnumber those who have been murdered by a blood thirsty gun owner.

52,Magazine,"""Mistrust""?  I know that he prefers conclusions that serve his purposes (i.e., Benghazi is a huge scandal, Donald Trump is the victim of a witch hunt) over anything for which there may be evidence.  A gloss like this suggests that Nunes may have a *reason*, perhaps at least partly valid, not to trust our intelligence apparatus.  He may have motives, but he has no reasons.  I think it would be better to say that Nunes *disregards*, rather than mistrusts, our intelligence agencies."
53,Magazine,"What a well-researched and written story. <br/><br/>However, I think the story can be summarized in one word. Love. <br/><br/>Devin Nunes fell in love with Donald Trump and for better or for worse will do anything for him.<br/><br/>But beware Mr. Nunes, just as he does his female flavors of the day, the President is famous for tossing his boys to the side once he decides they can no longer help him. Above all, watch your tender heart, Dev. "
54,Magazine,"The gist of this interminable article is that Nunes supports Trump, and therefore Nunes is an evil man. This is all that's required by the NYT Trump-haters, who wait expectantly each morning with their mouths open like baby Robins, waiting for their daily dose of anti-Trump news.<br/><br/>The rest of the article is just blah ... blah ... blah."

58,Magazine,"My problem is I have a memory.<br/><br/>I rememer Clapper, head of Intelligence, lying to the Senate Intelligence Committee that NSA wasn't collecting information on millions of innocent people.<br/><br/>I remember Snowden turning whistleblower in response--and proving what Clapper said were lies.<br/><br/>I remember the 60 Minutes interview of Wiliam Binney, who resigned from NSA after 30 years because the agency had intentionally decided not to use software costing millions that screened out innocent communications, and instead used a program costing billions that screened out no one.<br/><br/>And 12 armed FBI agents raiding Binney's home in response, taking his computer, papers, etc.<br/><br/>And I see Clapper on TV making claims about this or that and I know he willingly lies.<br/><br/>I trust Mueller.

59,Magazine,"âThe âfactsâ sent by The New York Times Magazine to check for this article, filled with laughable fictional stories and some entertaining conspiracy theories, are great examples of why so few people trust The New York Times anymore.â<br/><br/>Actually, Mr. Langer, Devin Nunes is a great example of why so few people have faith in Congress anymore.  An intellectually lazy, ethically suspect, highly partisan hack whose defining characteristic is a penchant for conspiracy theories   landed one of the ""most plum assignments"" on Capitol Hill.  And he got it when it was apparently common knowledge that he was an ""inattentive student"" on matters requiring his close attention.  <br/><br/>No wonder Donald Trump likes Nunes.  Both cut from the same cloth."

61,Magazine,Nunes and Ryan probably both have seats of honor at the WH dinner tonight. 
62,Metro,"Several years ago, my Monthly Meeting faced a pressing problem arising from the deterioration of the Stony Brook Meetinghouse roof.  Adjacent to the Princeton Battlefield, the Meetinghouse had been a ""field hospital"" to both Continental and British soldiers in the aftermath of the Battle.  It clearly has a place in American history.<br/><br/>But I was singularly opposed to seeking state funds for the project precisely because of the separation of church and state.  I had to ""stand aside"" and have my objection minuted in the face of a sense of the meeting that it was proper to seek such funds.  Fortunately, the application was rejected, the Meeting was able to raise the necessary funds and the project was completed.<br/><br/>The irony is that the NJ Constitution contains that prohibition specifically due to the wording of the Concessions of the Proprietors of West Jersey (written either by John Locke or William Penn), which was the Quaker group that settled the area in the late 1600s.  It's not a slam on religion...it's an express constraint on the incursion of politics into religion.  After all, it's a slippery slope from supporting a congregation to hindering it by the withdrawal of aid."
63,Well,"Maggie, I'm glad you made it through without a kidney transplant. I wasn't so lucky after contracting e-coli. I wish you all the best in the future and hope your kidneys stay strong for years to come. "
64,Well,"Obama's signature 2011 Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA) is designed to eliminate threats to fresh produce safety by getting farmers to eliminate potential sources of E.coli contamination on their farms (water, workers, manure/compost, animals, unclean tools or shipping crates, etc.). However beware, small farmers who sell their produce at farmer's markets are exempted. To their credit, the US fresh produce industry recognizes the threat of bacterial contamination and has not been lobbying Trump to loosen up or eliminate FSMA.  Surprisingly, most recent E.coli outbreaks have been association with domestic and not imported produce.  The threat is real and needs to be taken seriously."

67,Business,"Fascinating...<br/><br/>I think this speaks to the power that emotions have over logic. The Grimsby folks know that fishing is a bygone trade, and the fear that creates motivates fight/flight, ergo fighting to save a moribund industry. <br/><br/>As an American, I see the parallels with coal (as the author eluded to) as well the plight of Midwestern manufacturing. The emotional and cultural attachment to work is something to which we give little credence. It would do us well to do more to support communities that are on the receiving end of creative destruction in these ways. "
68,Games,"As a fan of Peter Gordon's later-in-the-week puzzles, I was curious to see how he would handle a Tuesday.  I thought he pulled it off quite nicely.  As a rule, I welcome more names and popular culture references in the puzzles, although I may be in the minority on this.  (I have great respect for our foreign solvers who tackle the puzzles without many of these cultural reference points.)"
69,Games,"When I saw John Donne, I thought it might be, (ASK NOT) FOR WHOM THE BELL TOLLS, but when I saw that was too long, I immediately entered NO MAN IS AN ISLAND. I love references like that.<br/><br/>Of the three referenced names, I remembered CUBA but not the rest of his name until I had most of the crosses. I managed to retrieve the other two islands but didn't even recognize their names when I got them. Nor do I expect to remember them.<br/><br/>As for your column, if I'm hopelessly stuck, I will come to it before finishing the puzzle and prefer just to get a single word to help me. Sometimes there's a string of answers and all in caps to boot! I guess one can only say, ""Reader beware!"" All is forgiven though, Deb, because your column is so interesting,  always teaching me something new, and with a lovely sense of both the importance as well as the ephemeral nature of our delight in crosswords.<br/><br/> Theme or Tricky Clues first? Follow your mood of the moment."
70,Games,"Like RIA, I don't come to the puzzle until I have completed it (or, in my case, completely given up but I won't speak for RIA on that).  Either way (as Big Jule would say).<br/>I thought this was an excellent Tuesday offering.  Not so easy that it wasn't fun plus a clever theme.  Never thought of the word CRUDITY.  If I had to come up with a meaning, I would have guessed cut-up vegetables eaten by a primitive group.<br/>Thank you Peter (and) Gordon."
71,Games,"@deb -- I like theme first, then tricky clues, going from the big picture to the specifics, but I don't feel strongly about it.  But the fact that you're considering flipping gives me hope that maybe Cohen will be also.<br/><br/>So to the puzzle. Peter knows names, which so often people and crowd his puzzles -- this puzzle had, by my count, nine people names, not counting the theme answers, or IRIS, JAKE, or GRIZABELLA. I often flinch at names, especially pop culture names, in puzzles, as opposed to my wife, who thrives on them, wants them in. All the names today, though, were in my brain, some closer to the surface than others. And GRIZABELLA, by the way, really livens up the grid.<br/><br/>I liked the clues for PETE and TEA BAGS, and the theme is clever and original, a wow, even if caromed off a fellow constructor's clue. Peter has such a talent for themes and throwing puzzles together -- it seems to come easy to him, whereas for me, puzzle making is like hacking through the vines (and yet I love the process). This puzzle had a mini-theme of answers ending with A (10), and certainly gets an A for the enjoyment it gave me. Thanks, Peter!"

The establishment that forced ""under God"" into the pledge in the 1950s couldn't keep their politics out of _our_ daily lives; why should we accept it and move on? America values freedom.

As they described the electoral history of the district, ""President Trump carried it 58 to 37 percent in 2016; Mitt Romney won it 62 to 37 percent in 2012.â <br/><br/>Something is happening that looks to shift the landscape for the GOP. They are narrowly winning elections that ought to be a cakewalk and losing those that they would have normally won. Seems like their policies and their president have become less tasty than before. For the rest of us, they are toxic. "
85,OpEd,"""Thereâs something tragically, fundamentally American, too, about an angry young white man with a firearm killing a bunch of strangers who have done him no harm.""<br/>Uh yeah  can't argue with that, but it tragic no matter who is doing the shooting. There are plenty of stories out there of random shootings out there committed by non whites.  Ms. Renki is expressing an opinion she doesn't really hold.  Probably to get reactions and attention (which admittedly I am doing here).  There is nothing (as of yet) to indicate the shooting was racially motivated nor is there any info on the racial makeup of the Waffle House patrons."
86,OpEd,Also his outburst is completely consistent with the conservative view that teachers are basically babysitters.
87,OpEd,The Republican Party is beholden to to the donor class. The donor class doesn't care about public schools or teachers. They send their children to private schools. We have been defunding public schools since the days of Ronald Reagan. This is the Republican platform. Keep them poor. Keep them uneducated and control the women.
88,OpEd,"""State and local governments, however, are basically school districts with police departments. Education accounts for more than half the state and local work force; protective services like police and fire departments account for much of the rest.""<br/><br/>Mr Krugman leaves out ""Healthcare"" - which subsidies now accounts for more than 40% of Massachusetts' budget, as well as increasing percentages of other states' budgets, due to insurance subsidies (and the high cost of ""healthcare"" in the US). <br/><br/>In our small town - and every one nearby in both our and neighboring New England states - public school education has neared or taken over half the local budgets. Thus the cost of rising property taxes that encourage retirees to move elsewhere. <br/><br/>Finally - there is the cost of all these public pensions &amp; related benefits (i.e., health insurance premiums): a well documented economic bomb that will soon inevitably explode. Then what?"
89,OpEd,"The title of this article says it all...in their heart...Republicans, especially in right leaning states, really believe our young people don't need an education. All young people need is a job in the mills/mines and good old common sense. Fast forward to 2018, the mills and mines are gone and companies are paying top dollar for brains that have disciplined to avoid common sense solutions. An underlying theme of making America great again is turning the clock back to a time when high school was all about football, homecoming, prom, and cheerleaders, and, college, well, who needs it. This antiquated belief still dominates in red states whose voters still yearn for their glory days. "
90,OpEd,"The problems with teacher pay have been simmering for my entire life (days away from turning 63). I wrote an op-ed for my college paper more than 44 years ago on this subject supporting professors, and had some of them approach me in public on the quad to thank me â and to a person they werenât Republicans; but even then, I â¦ WAS. This isnât unique to Republicans, or even âconservativesâ; but what does tend to be a rightist conviction is that the only way to keep government from completely enslaving the individual to collective needs as seen by liberal elites is to strangle its funding. THATâS what weâre seeing, and education tends to be collateral damage. When you cut and cut taxes to drown government in a bathtub, there simply are too few dollars left given the myriad of priorities that governors and state legislatures need to balance. And when the costs of Medicaid consume so MUCH of the budgets of even red states, that balancing act becomes precarious indeed.<br/><br/>Why canât our politics be more like â¦ ME? The eternal plaint, but Iâve always believed that I have a case and Paul doesnât.<br/><br/>There was a time when the willingness to tax for important things was a universal constant in America, among Democrats AND Republicans â oh, we disagreed sometimes on what was âimportantâ, and on how MUCH we should tax, but today thereâs very little basis for compromise and apparently none for agreement."
91,OpEd,"Ha, ha, and touche! You make an excellent, point, and it appears that this Bevin character is a piece of work!"
92,OpEd,it would require one or the other: higher pay or to restore the pensions (which many of them now won't get anyway--).  Historically the deal was that we paid teachers less in exchange for good benefits.  Now we are welshing on the benefits part.  Why go to four years of college to be poor?  You can be poor without incurring that debt.  This whole system with the rich having all the money and everyone else begging for pennies while maintaining all the professionalism society expects but won't pay for?  It isn't viable.

This is just wrong."
98,Express,"It seems the Canadian authorities are holding back information concerning the Driver of the Van. If this is not ISIS then who is behind it.Why is the public kept in the dark, The Canadian people should be made aware of their enemies."
99,Express,My thoughts are with the victims and the brave officer who showed incredible restraint and judgment in a difficult situation.
100,Express,"The emerging story of motive is part of a modern epidemic- mentally imbalanced loner, inspired and emboldened by internet troll community and sensational publicity of like events, decides to lash out at innocents using whatever means is available.  Seems like time to take reasonable precautions - bollards and tree planters guarding heavily trafficked pedestrian areas near roads, sensible gun control, increased mental health support and responsible journalism."
101,Express,"In the past few days  Americans and Canadians have both learned the cost for ignoring and/or not dealing with mental illness.  Not providing the funds for treating those with emotional and mental illnesses is one thing, but not having a process in place for reporting and referring folks we see in our workplaces, classrooms, and neighborhoods for the professional treatment that they need is proving deadly in our public places.  Whether the weapon is an AR 15 or a panel van, the result is the same=innocent people die when their deaths could have been prevented.  As a society and just as human beings, we need to improve how we deal with the problems of individuals and get them the help that they need."
102,Express,"Despite all the horrors yesterday, it should be noted that the lone police officer who first arrived at the scene was able to arrest the suspect without incident. This speaks volumes to the professionalism of our police, and makes be proud to be a Canadian.<br/><br/>Stay strong, Toronto. Canada stands with you"
103,Express,TV footage of arrest showed something interesting: police not blasting away at the suspect.
104,Express,"So very sad. Prayers for the family and community in this time of senseless loss. Intent to inflict harm upon innocents more dangerous than any weapon. As the world looks for solutions to violence we need to look at the problems that cause these symptoms. Violence directed at innocents is a symptom. Problems and percipients include alienation, hopelessness and fear of the future. "
105,Express,"A gun, no less an AR-15, is designed for one use - to kill. A truck has legitimate use to transport goods and people, and is not designed for killing. <br/><br/>Many material objects can be used in a manner they weren't created or designed for to impose fear and create carnage but that doesn't mean we should restrict the use or availability of them."
106,Express,No probably be the same headline.  It's the other way around.  Not terrorism until proven so.  And unless he had an ideological reason for the attack it cannot be called terrorism.
107,Express,"Because the police have charged him and the ""Crown""  and police will assemble all the evidence and prosecute him. The trial judge and jury, if applicable, will review the evidence and made a determination as to the accused's (note, not enemy's) guilt relative to the charges.

109,Express,The above poster's effort to mitigate tragedy that comes of one instrument used in its perpetration by making note of another reflects the deep-seated twist in the hearts of such a one that holds preference for what is used in rendering mayhem.
110,Express,I agree.  The cops may have learned from those incidents and may even have had training to deal with people with such problems.  I hope police forces in other cities do the same.  
111,Express,"The video indicates the police did have their guns drawn.  They just declined to shoot, a big difference in most American police response.  "

These regulations are mostly common sense and are widely supoorted by Canadians, who have no wish to have an American model of firearm ownership. You can keep the NRA and your millions of guns to yourselves. We doing very well without them."
116,Express,"Cities are always looking for ways to make traffic safer for pedestrians, cyclists and for drivers.  There are constant efforts to control speed, direct traffic, develop crash avoidance technologies and prevent accidents.  I am sure in response to these purposeful acts of violence, cities will start building safety measures into infrastructure.  Point being, complicated problems require many different approaches to solve, and even then there will be outliers and those who get around the laws.  That doesn't mean that efforts shouldn't be made.  But incidents like this are used by partisans in the US to prevent ANY efforts at finding solutions to the problem of gun violence.  There's a reason Toronto has 10 deaths in 2018 due to mass vehicular homicide while the US has 1081 deaths so far in 2018 attributable to mass shootings."

125,Arts&Leisure,"It's a fair comment that the Marvel Universe movies are pretty formulaic and predictable.  That said there are a lot of gems in there that have something new to say:  the worn-out sadness of life wearing down in Logan, the chaotic profanity in Deadpool, and the futuristic African aesthetic and symbolism in Black Panther all seemed to be new and interesting takes. Even, Guardians of the Galaxy, Doctor Strange, and the Winter Soldier introduced new aspects on the formula that made them worth a watch. <br/><br/>If superhero movies aren't your thing, that's fine.  I get why they wouldn't appeal to everyone.  But I would say that to put them into a single black box and cast a pox on all of them would seem to miss some nuance and distinctions that can be quite interesting and even thought-provoking."
126,Arts&Leisure,"Watched every film in the series and enjoyed them immensely. Escapist entertainment certainly seems to fill a need with villains and supervillains occupying key positions in government. <br/><br/>Perhaps, with the Avengers saga slowing down, Disney could turn its massive  attention to proven print universes that have been waiting for the money and technology to come to life. There are two that I believe deserve this: Orson Scott Card's ""Tales of Alvin Maker"" and Larry Niven's ""Known Space"". I'm sure other readers have favorites as well. "
127,Arts&Leisure,"This is the end of the beginning for Marvel Studios.  Just like what Stan Lee did around 1966 or so when he reshuffled the original Avengers line-up, in the next decade (2020 to 2029) we will see a fresh Avengers line-up, a quality version of the Fantastic Four, and a much-needed revamped X-Men.  And thatâs just scratching the surface!"
128,Arts&Leisure,This sounds like a monumental effort on the part of The Russo Brothers. I enjoyed their earlier television and Captain America movie work. I wish them the best and plan to be in the theater (lord willing) when they debut.

131,Arts&Leisure,"When they refer to Iron-Man as second-rate/tier, I assumed they were referring to his popularity outside the periodicals. "
132,Arts&Leisure,"Actually, no sorry, I didn't notice.   Even as a kid I paid little attention to Marvel comics.   I was a fan of DC comics and never really went in for the superhero racked by anxiety and doubt type of superhero.   But  hey, we all have different opinions, and to each his/her own.  "
133,Arts&Leisure,Let me guess: You weâre not happy about Kendrick Lamarâs Pulitzer.
134,Arts&Leisure,I thought X-Men: First Class was pretty good. Days of Future Past and Apocalypse were a step down though. No coincidence that Matthew Vaughn directed First Class I think - Singer can be too 'by the numbers'.
135,Arts&Leisure,"Exactly! I couldn't agree more...First Class was an actual film with so much substance. I would really love to see more super hero flicks written like that. But I would also like to give credit to the Marvel filmamkers! Captain America, Thor, Avengers and Black Panther were pretty good too"
136,Arts&Leisure,"Pray tell, which mentor died in Thor. Or Iron Man 2/3. Ant-Man. Guardians of the Galaxy. Civil War. The latest Spider-Man. (For that matter, any Spider-Man movie where Uncle Ben died at the hands of a supervillain.) As for the rest of it, that's the classic Hero's Journey monomyth, which has been around forever and will be around long after superhero movies are gone. Get used to it."
137,Arts&Leisure,"Yeah, but weâve got a decadeâs reprieve."
138,Arts&Leisure,That's a good reason for Marvel to distance themselves. It's a bad reason for the New York Times not to mention Whedon at all. They could mention the allegations as well. They didn't because they decided to write what was essentially free copy for Disney. 
139,Arts&Leisure,But what about mediocre things?
140,Arts&Leisure,"I would have to disagree with you about Logan. It was indeed pretty depressing, but that aesthetic was in service of a pretty powerful them: the despair and anguish of a hero past his ability to do anything heroic and counting down his declining days with nothing to do but survive and waste away until his inevitable demise.   The thought it was poignant in a powerful way and reflected a feeling a lot of over-the-hill guys eventually start to feel. "

156,Culture,"The mind, this judgmental mind, will never be satisfied with the body that it sees in the mirror. The judgmental mind judges. It judges others relentlessly. It judges ourselves relentlessly. The controls to the judgmental mind cannot be accessed and we cannot turn it off. So, how do we come into a more compassionate relationship with our judgmental mind? Rather than try to appease it, or control it, or deny it, we can practice simply acknowledging it and holding it with clarity and kindness. ""Oh, hello, my judgmental mind! What stories are you telling today?"" When we can see that our judgmental mind is simply doing the work that it was made to do, then we are in a much better position to hold those judgments lightly and compassionately, and perhaps not take what they say quite so seriously. This body that I have in this moment is the only body I could possibly have in this moment. It is miraculous and mortal and will return to the earth soon enough. This mind that judges everything is miraculous and mortal and will return to the earth soon enough. Let us appreciate and revel in the body and mind we have. This ephemeral miracle. "
157,Culture,"One reason this is ""so hard to talk about"" is that no position is offered which is free from critique, and no guide offered on the best way to think about beauty. Such a guide would have to account for society's standards, including cultural variants, and when to accept and when to reject them; how much personal autonomy to ""feel beautiful,"" no matter what, is important, including whether it has to include elements of willed self-delusion; how to reconcile when different parts of your brain are telling you different things; and, as another commentator says, how much of this is biology. Even if beauty, both how we view and respond to it, including elements of denial, arguably  deserves some attention, as another commentator points out, aren't there much more important things in life? If despite misgivings, some engagement is justifiable, wouldn't it be better to get past that level, even if it takes some scarce willpower? "

We Americans are awash in excess low-grade calories, and pretending we're beautiful as we scarf down more isn't smart. <br/><br/>Our actions make us beautiful, but we do need to take care of our bodies through activity, diet, and lifestyle. No one needs rock hard abs and butts, but we should ask our doctors how beautiful type 2 diabetes and heart disease are. "
168,Culture,"One solution - stop watching the videos, going on Instragram, going to movies like this, buying the magazines, etc.  Focus on being healthy.  "
169,Culture,"Just the fact that Emily Ratajkowski has 17 million Instagram followers while the star of the movie has only 6.7 million says tons about the importance people place on beauty.  <br/><br/>I think Schumer missed a big opportunity here with this movie.  With her boldest work she's shown to have a sharp eye on society's hypocrisy on the matters regarding sexual politics.  While she is what most women in the world may look like, she's still not good enough to warrant as many social media followers as someone who's looks vs her brain are her career.  "
170,Culture,"I wonder when people are going to wake up and realize that they are living, for an infinitesimally short time, on a rock hurtling through space and that each and ever living thing is a miracle when should be enjoyed and appreciated for it's own individual beauty?  Worrying about how you look should be just about the last thing on anyone's mind and yet people waste so much of their time and energy on it.  Imagine what the world could be if people spent the same time/energy worrying about the well-being of their planet/neighbors/fellow creatures as they do about whether or not they look old or fat or whatever other way they imagine they're not supposed to look.  How stupid we all are."
171,Culture,"Wouldnât it be great if women (men, too) could find/create communities in which deeper and higher values were affirmed, cultivated, and lived out practically?"
172,Culture,"I agree with everything you said. I am not obese but, now that I am older, it's very difficult even to lose 10 lbs. But someone please tell me why there is not so much of an obesity problem in Europe? If you travel through France, you almost never see an obese person. That goes for England, Germany, Holland et al.  I've heard that it's red wine, that it's eating leeks, that it's not eating red meat, but in France they eat enormous amounts of red meat, and not so many leeks. It really is puzzling.  Fast food is the only culprit I can come up with, which is not consumed as much in other countries. Also, they don't snack between meals."
173,Culture,"Your mistake is in believing these women when they're calling out what they claim are their unattractive features. It's called humble bragging. It used to be called fishing â a beauty putting herself down to soak up the inevitable comments like, ""Oh, no you're so gorgeous, you're perfect."""
174,Culture,"Because we are constantly bombarded by advertising that tells us we're not good enough.  Corporations that sell ""beauty"" make no money if we're satisfied with how we look. "

Now that it's at a low roar I'm learning new things and ramping up the activity level, yet again!  You don't need a rigorous regime just one that keeps you moving and as healthy as possible.  I shut out unhelpful unsolicited advice. No one knows what's best for me but me. No one knows what's best for you but you. "

177,Culture,I didn't say skinny...I said thin implying body fat in to 25-30% range which is what all sources say is the desirable range...in other words thin vs. fat.  I don't know why having a normal body fat percentage should encourage anorexia or eating disorders.

Try asking men what they think about makeup, and you may be surprised. Most of us don't give a damn or actually prefer no makeup, because what we're interested in is the woman underneath.<br/><br/>On the other hand, clothing and self care do indicate social class; in that, men and women differ little. See Veblen.<br/><br/>As to evolutionary psychology, stuff and nonsense. You are attempting to apply ideology to science, a losing proposition for the ideologue. But in fact, what I discussed is actually far older and more basic to evolutionary science. ""Sexual selection was first proposed by Charles Darwin in The Origin of Species (1859) and developed in The Descent of Man and Selection in Relation to Sex (1871), as he felt that natural selection alone was unable to account for certain types of non-survival adaptations. He once wrote to a colleague that 'The sight of a feather in a peacock's tail, whenever I gaze at it, makes me sick!' His work divided sexual selection into male-male competition and female choice.""<br/><br/><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_selection#Darwin"" title=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_selection#Darwin"" target=""_blank"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_selection#Darwin</a><br/><br/>I think you will profit more by learning something of the actual science than you will by from the baseless blathering of the ideological and uninformed."

180,Culture,"If only it were that easy. <br/><br/>I've struggled with trying to measure up to society's expectations regarding appearances since junior high. I have absolutely no skill when it comes to hair or clothes or makeup. And frankly, I have no interest in wasting my time and money trying to look a certain part. <br/><br/>Unfortunately, in order to be considered ""professional"" in the workplace, and to be considered for positions of prestige and advancement, there are certain expectations placed on women regarding how we should dress. And these expectations are far more cumbersome than those placed on men in the workplace. <br/><br/>For me, it's become existential. Even if I choose to ignore beauty standards on an intellectual level, it's very challenging on a emotional level to not fall prey to these expectations and other subconscious biases. It's a daily battle that has nothing to do with attracting men. As the author noted, it's really about proving my worth as a human being - knowing full well that if I follow the beauty standards I'm effectively denying who I really am. "

Please know that not all doctors are pill mills who have sold their souls to Big Pharma.

In some cases, they are life changing.  In others, they don't work or have unacceptable side effects.  There is no one-size-fits-all approach.<br/>I cringe when I see comments that can best be summarized  as ""resist the pill pushers"" or ""meds for everyone""  Medicine, like life, is all about shades of gray.

208,Well,"I grow so weary of shills narrowing the line of discourse to advance a prejudice. The co-extensive is the operative, not the private independent. The problem is NOT that a product does predictable and reproducible harm in a particular and selected individual every time and in a predetermined and predictable way. The problem (or rather one of them) is how does the introduction of a very powerful technology into nested sets of complex inter-relative systems affect the vast implex of processes across all of their permutations. And if some good can be argued for it (say food supply) the path of sensible caution demands that we weigh these supposed benefits against potential harms wherever they exist. The articles implicit intellectual bounding is the kind of argument that lends climate deniers, flat Earthers, and eugenics advocates legitimacy. Oversimplifying complex interactions and effects may enable a technician to reproduce a desired effect, but must not be given any more credence than it deserves. In all of their diversity, GMOs intrude on many plateaus of interpenetrating contexts, and we must look at them across their ramifications. For example, rather than deploying a GMO seed to produce plants resistant to Round Up, perhaps we should quit using the stuff and work towards ecological, agricultural, legal, business, social, etc. systems that combine in effective and healthy ways--in the longest of terms. No shot in the arm for shareholders, but something to live with."
209,Well,"This article completely ignores a few important facts about GMO products and practices.  The industrial scale use of GMO crops coupled with Glyphosate/24D and other 'safe' toxic herbicides/pesticides are destroying soil, water and native species populations (soil microbes, insects, bees/pollinators, birds, plants and obviously those losses affect the entire ecosystem.

214,Well,"@Michael M, I grew up on a  sorghum' farm', I have hayed and mowed, and the idea that more efficient farming is allowing fields to lie fallow is a joke. the only time the percentage of fallow fields w ill increase is if the gov expands paying big farmers not to grow something. Really - how silly - more efficient farming allows fields to lay fallow. NO farmer will recognize that equation as anyhting remotely related to reality."

217,Learning,"Some seniors are at a retirement home and want to get a workout in. Despite not being ""in"" with the youth, they still want to be healthy and get that ""Alexis Ren body"". They also probably need to get their circulation going and such which makes this gym session understandable. The elders are being told what to do as they workout on the mats. Their workout is being filmed."
218,Learning,"There are several possibility for whats going on this this picture. Considering they are all elder one possibility could be they are practicing getting up after they've taken a fall. It could also be a dance class for older people, they are preparing and stretching. Also it could be some sort of either physical therapy, or even just normal therapy. Honestly there are lots of things that this pictures could be. But those are some examples on what i think is going on in this picture! :)) "
219,Learning,"I also think that these elderly are practicing falling, as they are all lying on their left side. The mat's orientation could be a symbol for the organization these people are a part of. "
220,Learning,It looks like a bunch of old folks trying to play dead to hide from something.
221,Learning,In this picture I see 10 elderly people laying on mats. One is blue and the other is red. There are 5 people on the red mat and 5 people on the blue mat. They also have 2 guys and 3 women on each mat. 
222,Learning,In this photo there is 10 elderly people laying down. The men and women are laying on large mats on the ground. The setting is probably in some sort of gym maybe. The people are sleeping together possibly. I don think the people know each other and they are just there together.
223,Learning,"@Anisha L, @Alisa, @Juhee, @Patrick C, Maia B, Jordan L, In this picture, some of you infer group exercise, yoga or rehabilitation therapy, while others see rest after sport or possibly even napping.  I'm curious to know more.  What is it that makes infer these different meanings?  What more can we find?"
224,Learning,We see older people laying on the mats. They look like fell down. We think maybe they are in a class where they are practicing how to get up safely after a fall.
225,Learning,"In this picture, I see 5 males and 5 women elders. They are all laying on mats. I think they all fell or something and trying to get back up or something like that. They are in a gym in assuming. They also could be playing a game or something. "
226,Learning,This old people are doing a type of exercise. The reason I believe this is because there are some kind of mats that are found in a gym. The blue mat is divided with a white line. One side is for men and the other one is for women. 
227,Learning,people trying matrices
228,Learning,There is a bunch of old people that look like there In some type of class trying to learn something .This photo her laying on mats which are red and blue and this picture seems to be taken on a basketball court so which seems like they maybe in a yoga class or just stretching out on the floor. They might be learning physical and mental knowledge because of their doing on he floor which seems like yoga.
229,Learning,I think that this 10 elderly men and women are laying down for a pill experiment. The elders in the blue probably have similar problems and the elders in the red mats have similar problems and they are probably going to compare. I also see six little mats that probably were for more elders who were done with their experiment. 
230,Learning,These elderly people are laying on gym mats. There are 5 people on each of the big mats. Everyone's feet are hanging off of the side of the mats. I think they are all trying to roll around the mat without letting their feet touch the mat.
231,Learning,"In this photo I'm noticing five human beings on each mat. The blue mat separates two gentleman from three women with a line down the middle. To me , this kind of looks like a mathematical fraction: 2/3. I'm not sure if that carries any significance here. All of these people seem to carry characteristics of the elderly: white hair, hunched posture, thinning hair. I notice that there are five smaller mats below that to me resemble dominoes. Maybe they are participating in some kind of live math equation or demonstration. This might also be a part of a promotion for the healthcare of the elderly or a program some kind of statistic."
232,Learning,It seems like they are laying on a mat resting.
233,Learning,"In this photograph, senior citizens are taking a course on what to do if they find themselves in an emergency situation. Everyone in the picture seems to be of similar age over 70. The setting of the photo is inside what looks to be like a gymnasium or a rec center most likely in the town they live in. There are multiple mats in the photo, many of which are not being used at the moment suggesting that they have done, or will be doing another safety exercise with the smaller mats towards the bottom of the picture. The instructor of the program, although not pictured in the photo, is most likely showing the group the best position to be in while waiting for help if they have fallen and cannot get up. Each person in the photo is in the same position, on their side with one arm out and their legs bent. This could be the best way to lay to minimize the risk of injury in the instance an elderly person has fallen. There is a mix of male and female members showing that the course can be taken by any senior that wants to take it. It is important to be educated in the case of an emergency, and by completing a course like this, elderly people can become better prepared if they find themselves in an emergency situation."
234,Learning,In this picture i believe that they are trying to see how many people can fit in a csr or vehicle.they have rectangles trying to fit people on them the best they can.They have boxed out space that can amd cant be used.they have red and blue rectangles which could br different thing

242,Science,"A tragic story to be sure, but the scientist in me does not like coincidences.  <br/><br/>I can't help wondering how this mutation was induced in Dr. Soo-Kyung's lab animals and if there is any possibility it might have affected her own child?<br/><br/>Scientific history is full of stories where experimentalists paid a steep price for their research.  Madame Curie died of radiation induced anemia while the Demon Core killed 2 people promptly and shortened the lives of half a dozen more.    <br/><br/>The damage is done.   It would be a shame not to learn from it, but to do that we have to acknowledge some uncomfortable possibilities."

246,Science,"You're correct in the sense that we shed dead skin cells (and others) that still contain DNA. Less well appreciated is that we also take in DNA all the time in the fresh food we eat - hence biology labs extracting it from a strawberry. <br/><br/>This isn't a problem because, first, all DNA is biochemically the same, only differing in sequence of the 4 genetic letters (bases). And, it almost all get's broken down in digestion along with everything else. The intestine absorbs individual pieces and very small fragments (a few nucleotides) of your food's DNA, not whole genes.<br/><br/>So, to answer your larger question: You do NOT have to worry about 'absorbing genes' from others. Nature thought about this a long, long time ago! "
247,Science,"Refugio Enriquez: Okay, nature didn't literally 'think' of this, but did so in a manner of speaking. All animals are exposed to DNA from other species they consume but they break this DNA down in digestion into the common building blocks (nucleotides) that can be used to build their own DNA.<br/><br/>We also do not absorb DNA through our skin or by somehow breathing it in, as several comments here seem to suggest. (""Did the lab mutation get into her?"" or words to that effect.) Now THAT sort of thinking is putting enormous faith in coincidences!  <br/><br/>Bacteria have 'horizontal gene transfer' - between individual cells, vs 'vertical' transfer in reproduction - and while this occurring in multicellular organisms is possible (and controversial) it's likely to be limited to rare and specific cases of evolution. <br/><br/>Also evolution/natural selection doesn't ""plan,"" is not omniscient, nor does it produce perfect organisms - that would be the fallacy of ""intelligent design"" - just organisms that are the best adapted SO FAR to their environment."

252,Upshot,"Being in the health industry, I've long been dismayed by California and its demands on countless items/chemicals that they be labeled as causing cancer or toxicity.  The truth is, CA requires manufacturers that sell anything in CA, not just store owners, to have specific warnings. Just for the state of CA.  <br/><br/>This is costly, but more importantly, unjustified with any reasonable data whatsoever.  The US has it's list that require labeling, such as cigarettes mentioned in this article.  It is extensive.  But, according to non-experts and non-scientists in CA (and Europe, as it is competing with CA these days), it's not nearly extensive enough.  <br/><br/>CA likes regulations and their politicians take joy in writing new legislation daily, but there is no positive outcome from their nonsense.  And, they don't care.  "
253,Upshot,"We have become numb from warnings after warnings. <br/><br/>And we wonder why the attention span is becoming shorter and shorter.<br/><br/>There is some risk to nearly every human activity.

257,Upshot,My parents kept a stove top coffee percolator going all day for all their adult lives and lived until their 90's. Wasn't there just a study out last year saying coffee is good for you? Now it's bad. In 5 years it'll be good again. It's hard not to be cynical about these half-baked studies and the motives of those who publish them. Moderation in everything is the best way to go.
258,Upshot,"I live in California and note the presence of Proposition 65 warning signs, to the effect that ""These premises contain chemicals known to the state of California to cause cancer,"" near the entrance to every office, apartment, condominium, and retail store. These Proposition 65 warnings have become so ubiquitous, that you would have to place yourself under house arrest to avoid exposure.<br/><br/>While I am not technically qualified to judge the risks posed by acrylamide in coffee, I am quite confident that California's Proposition 65 far exceeds the threshold for legislative ridiculosity."
259,Upshot,"With all respects, Doctor, you are confusing risk assessment and exposure.  Proposition 65 is NOT a risk based health system, but mandates warnings for carcinogens and reproductive toxins in  mixtures unless the seller can quantify the No Observable Effect Level (NOEL) and that the potential for exposure to that toxin would result in a dose two orders of magnitude below that level.  Having litigated cases in California under this law for over twenty five years, I am a witness to its shortcomings, especially its failure to address risk, as opposed to exposure.  The defense in the case failed to understand that concept and tried to defend the case based on risk, which is why they lost.  <br/><br/>Like the boy  who cried ""Wolf!""  Proposition 65's warnings are mostly ignored.  Whether that is sound policy is in dispute, but the judge's ruling is technically correct. "
260,Upshot,People will never stop drinking coffee! It's thoroughly embedded in the culture! It's too cool!
261,Upshot,Could it be California?
262,Upshot,"There is very little (if any) evidence that warning labels change behavior.  If you want to change behavior, prove there is a clear and convincing case for public safety and then levy a massive tax for consuming that particular product.  Let those who would disproportionately consume our public health care dollars pay it forward and, hopefully, change their behavior before their health deteriorates.<br/><br/>But if you can't make a clear and convincing case that a particular product poses a major public health risk, stop trying to arbitrarily regulate them.  It's a waste of time and energy that accomplishes nothing.<br/><br/>Somewhere between fanatical libertarianism and fanatical big-brotherism lie intelligent and effective solutions that benefit the public."
263,Upshot,"Hereâs an alternative viewpoint. Clearly, the evidence for acrylamide and cancer is not (yet) strong. But what has been confirmed for decades is that acrylamide is a potent neurotoxin that can cause serious neurological problems. It is used in industrial drinking water systems and long ago the EPA set very low allowable limits for acrylamide in drinking water that are far below what is in brewed coffee.<br/><br/>Now, acrylamide is clearly more a threat in potato chips, French fries, snacks and cigarettes. But Prop 65 is called âThe Safe Drinking Waterâ for a reason and acrylamide as a neurotoxin is a serious concern in drinking water. So, Prop 65 is actually doing its job by alerting the public about this threat. Given that literally thousands of chemicals used in foods and other products have never been tested for toxicity, Prop 65 is one of the few warning systems putting pressure on food and coffee manufacturers. <br/><br/>Acrylamide also interacts with other neurotoxins to create a leveraging effect (studies by LoPachin). Parents should know that due to their daily diets children each day ingest 2X as much acrylamide on a per pound bodyweight basis as adults. Given their still developing neurological systems and the rise in autism, ADD, ADHD, etc. in recent decades, maybe we shouldnât dismiss acrylamide as a health threat so quickly. And maybe the Times needs to research acrylamide as a neurotoxic compound threat to in drinking water and food. You could start your research with the EPA."
264,Upshot,"I'm hoping against hope that the judge is testing the absurdity of Prop. 65 rather than making a sincere finding about coffee. The proposition system in California is an expensive and pernicious joke. The dim and easily fooled electorate can always be duped, as we see time and time again."
265,Upshot,"Proposition 76 which mandated warnings of carcinogenicity is the perfect example of a well-intended policy with unintended consequences. Industry fought its passage tooth-and-nail and then discovered the proposition was largely meaningless, because soon almost everything was so labelled. The idea that people would make ""smart"" choices was quickly proved dubious, inasmuch as choices were not always easily available, gasoline being the prime example.<br/><br/>This is much like the situation with drugs. Formerly, we knew practically nothing about adverse side effects and contraindications. Again, the industry fought adequate labeling. But, they solved their ""problem"" by putting so much information in such fine print on the labeling, that it has become functionally meaningless to the consumer."
266,Upshot,Well articulated. It makes you wonder whether only judges with a scientific background or some knowledge of statistics should be able to make calls on issues like this.
267,Upshot,"The real problem here is not proposition 65 (which is wrongheaded but probably well-intentioned). The problem is the indiscriminate granting of non-profit status to just about any organization that claims to act in the public interest. The phrase 'similar warnings' in the second paragraph of the story is a link to another Times article: <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/30/business/coffee-cancer-warning.html"" title=""https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/30/business/coffee-cancer-warning.html"" target=""_blank"">https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/30/business/coffee-cancer-warning.html</a> Here we learn that the lawsuit was brought by an organization called the Council for Education and Research on Toxics (CERT). A little research will show that CERT doesn't even have a website. However, it does appear to be QUITE a shady organization <a href=""http://schachtmanlaw.com/the-council-for-education-and-research-on-toxics/"" title=""http://schachtmanlaw.com/the-council-for-education-and-research-on-toxics/"" target=""_blank"">http://schachtmanlaw.com/the-council-for-education-and-research-on-toxics/</a><br/>I'm afraid that Mr. Carroll has missed the real story here. This lawsuit was a SCAM. Come on NYT, let's get on the case!"
268,Upshot,"It's the case of ""Chicken Little"" crying ""The Sky is falling, the Sky is falling."" No one pays much attention to these things anymore. Over the years so many dozens of claims pro and con regarding coffee. Caffeine is considered a schedule one drug, yet no one regulates it. What was the incentive to categorize and single out coffee from fries, and where did the push to label it dangerous originate from? As I sit here, I am having my coffee ""fix"" with a cinnamon teabag. Delish"
269,Upshot,A perfect example of nanny state run amok. And of course this kind of regulation is useless and counterproductive.  I you tell people everything in their day to day lives causes cancer they will correctly ignore the warnings. Which is a shame because some of the warnings are probably worth heeding. 
270,Upshot,I guess I'll be OK as long as I don't have a donut with my coffee...that would be over-reaching I guess.
271,Upshot,"Is it any wonder that Trump gained the support he did.  Perspective, common sense, nuance - all out the window.   Creation of a nanny state.  Identity politics to the front with binary judgments of anyone that disagrees.  An all out attack on anything white and western.  All backed by a suing at the drop of a hat and an social media system that resembles mob rule.  Sorry, it's Monday and I haven't had my coffee."
272,Upshot,"Knowledge is power. Dismissing evidence is willful ignorance. But coffee is a mixed blend. We know coffee/caffeine is dangerous to pregnant women, increasing miscarriages, preterm births and developmental defects - so we warn women to avoid it. <br/><br/>What is less known and increasingly more dangerous is the water with which we make our coffee. <br/><br/>Fluoridated water also increases the risk of preterm births &amp; pregnancy complications. Fluoride is an neurointoxicant - a poison. <br/><br/>Municipalities who use chloramine as a disinfectant also experience more premature births and pregnancy complications. <br/><br/>It's up to you whether you choose to drink coffee, but its up to all of us to ensure that our water is safe for everyone. Insist on safer disinfectant methods &amp; end fluoridation.  "
273,Upshot,I am certainly worried about environmental causes of cancer but I couldn't agree more about the dangers of putting a warning on everything for just about anything.  As a parent of young children and a laboratory researcher I see this all the time.  Nearly every thing is labeled as a choking hazard to the point where the designation is meaningless - I don't even look at those labels anymore and rely on my own common sense.  In the lab every chemical comes with an MSDS to describe the hazards of a particular substance and the equipment that should be used in handling it - those too are so frequently over the top that I always check with a chemist in our lab to see what precaution is actually called for.  Some things really are very dangerous and labeling everything as such just makes it harder to distinguish. 
274,Upshot,"I rarely agree with writer Aaron E. Caroll, but I agree with him in this case. As a vegan, I believe it would make more sense to label meat, fish, eggs and dairy as probable carcinogens, since the evidence is much stronger that these foods can cause cancer. I have a feeling Carroll would disagree.  "
275,Upshot,"If you read the article, corn flakes are likely to contain acrylamide from the way they are prepared. Combine that withe the sharp edges you mention and the results could be devestating. "
276,Upshot,"Well, I would, if, as is the case here, there is no actual epidemiological data linking coffee and cancer."
277,Upshot,"Jon J, pay attention.  This was not legislation, it is the result of voter initiative. "
278,Upshot,"Like many things,coffee is ambidexterous."
279,Upshot,"Huh? Tea is also thoroughly embedded in other cultures and it has nothing to with being cool. I mean, I drink my coffee at home in the morningâI donât think anyone would find the setting particularly cool."
280,Upshot,"ummm, no...still made from roasted beans - thanks for trying, though."
281,Upshot,"I would agree with you to a large extent, but I fear the problem is the huge army of lawyers who love to sue just about anybody for just about anything as long as there is no warning and no expectancy to use common sense. And I fear that legal system is fairly common to all 50 states? The lawyers and their greed is the real problem."
282,Upshot,"Sorry, this is still no excuse for supporting Trump."
283,Upshot,"The top choking hazards that actually results in child deaths are: marshmallows, gumballs, and hot dogs.  Most people are unaware of this because we put warning labels on all small parts!!"
284,Upshot,"There is an extraordinary amount of evidence that certain GMOs can cause problems for humans and for other living things. It is just denial that all GMOs are harmless, denial funded by the deep deep pockets of agri-business."

286,Washington,"âDismantledâ? There are at least 10 million Americans who beg to differ.<br/><br/>Obama and his administration are responsible for finally defeating Republican and military obstructionistsâled by John McCainâand ending Donât Ask, Donât Tell. With Eric Holder helming the Justice Department, they worked extensively to legalize same-sex marriage. Iâll never forget his televised address, the power of a sitting president affirming the humanity and dignity of gay Americans when half the country was still against us. It was a cultural watershed. The man did more to normalize homosexuality than any politician in the countryâs history. By the time Obergefell reached SCOTUS, a majority of Americans were on our side, no doubt a crucial factor in Kennedyâs deciding vote. I sobbed when he handed down the ruling; it was like the lifting of a massive weight from my shoulders, one I didnât even realize was there.<br/><br/>Thereâs no going back to DADT, and, with marriage equality established and an even larger (and growing) majority of Americans supporting it, Iâm much more confident than not that itâs here to stayâeven with an Evangelical puppet in the White House. In other words, youâre wrong; his legacy wonât be dismantled. And in fifty years, when a gay kid doesnât have to worry that his parents will stop loving him after he comes out and two women can take their children to a restaurant without fear of being kicked out, weâll look back on Obama and hail him as a civil rights hero."
287,Sports,"I have a lot of respect for Mr. Barone withholding the name of the coach who verbally abused him. I imagine it would have been easy to succumb to the quick validation of revenge and a public witch hunt. He probably could have gotten the coach's job and 15 minutes of fame, but he took the high road. <br/><br/>I predict that he will find himself (begrudgingly, perhaps) on the high road a lot in his future.  That's the hand Mr. Barone was played, and judging by how his work is described here, he deserves to move on to the higher levels of the sport. A lot of NHL refs have a superiority and infallibility complex. The league could use more guys who really care about getting it right and improving on their craft. Maybe he'll even, one day, be able to figure out what goalie interference in the NHL is. One can hope."

289,Learning,"I don't agree with Ms. Ko's opinion of it being expected that women smile. I think it is more of an all around gender thing. I have never personally expected a woman to smile more than a man. Being American does take a toll on expressing happiness as we are a country that is supposed to feel happy and free. I dont have any personal experiences but there is the stereotype with America that there is always smiling people.<br/>Being told to smile can make someone feel better or it could make someone feel worse. When someone asks me to smile it makes me feel like someone cares and maybe i should smile to put me in a better mood. But then again you never know what truly could be going on in someone's life at the moment. Some people, including myself will put on a fake smile just so people do not question your happiness and this could be for personal reasons. I try to smile at random people all the time to build a connection, or to even let them know that i have acknowledged them. "
290,Learning,"After reading this article, one may say that a smile did appear on my face. Smiling, to me, is a way that most human beings use to communicate as a way of showing their fine/ok. I think, as Ms. Ko claims a study has determined, that being told to smile does actually help a person feel better. The version of ''fake it till you make it'' is something that has sometimes worked for me, however other times not so greatly. All in all, everybody should smile for the simple fact of being human."
291,Foreign,"There is something frankly amazing in the idea that Europe has some particular moral obligation to solve the problems of African countries that have now all been independent for as long as they were colonized, ie. between 60 &amp; 70 years in most cases and again, the number of countries where there was real colonisation, with movement of significant numbers of European colonizers ie. more than a few tens of thousands, to  the colonized countries was tiny:  South Africa, Algeria...?  Furthemore, when most African countries gained their independance, their GNP/habitant was higher than many Asian countries which are now way ahead of them in terms of developement. Even China, a very late starter with a massive population, is now way ahead of any African country in terms of GDP/habitant, more than 8000$ versus an average of less than 2000$/person right across Africa, even including North Africa which in principle has always been well connected with world trade routes.<br/>No, quite clearly, things will only imporve in Africa when its leaders take genuine responsability for their countries futures, clean up on curruption and get their demogrpahics under control ie. population increase  from 275 million in 1960 to 1.2 billion in 2016 -&gt; 430%<br/>The population of the EU which was greater than the population of Africa in 1960, (400 million), is now (500 million) so dwarfed by the population of Africa that emigration to Europe can in no way be a solution to the continent's problems."

In lower cost/low tax areas like Oklahoma there isn't a union and most likely no cost of living adjustments.  I work in the private sector that oversees a very large state IT program.

POTUS won't do it either.  So, thankfully we have Special Counsel Mueller really draining the swap when Former President Obama was in office and the new swamp brought to our nation's Capitol by Trump.<br/><br/>Now, it's up to the American voters being aware of everything in this powerful New York Times Editorial to demand heads of banks, lawyers and all found to violate Federal law be brought before a Federal Judge to serve jail time.  <br/><br/>Yes, ""Mr. Mueller is showing prosecutors a better way to deal with white-collar crime."".<br/><br/>The business as usual cutting a deal to escape being brought before a Judge must end."
327,Editorial,You wonât know what Muellerâs team has uncovered or not uncovered about possible collusion between Trumpâs campaign and Russia until the investigation is complete. None of us know. Why draw conclusions about it prematurely?

337,Metro,"I believe  both Mayor DeBlasio and Governor are largely correct in their assessments of each other-the Mayor is incompetent and the governor is pernicious and both are understatements. <br/><br/>Both do share one thing in common-they are, in my opinion, corrupt. The mayor has carried out the same corrupt as Nassau County Executive Mangano has, with the same person no less, but one is being prosecuted and the other is not. One of Governor Cuomo's chief aides has been found guilty of corruption and another is coming to trial. When you consider what a control freak the governor is, it is obvious he had knowledge what they were doing. Poor New York."
338,Metro,"Born and raised in New York City, I am furious with how De Blasio has turned our city into garbage dump. The streets are laden with filth. The homeless, so many of whom settle in on Park Avenue and Broadway islands, are a danger to pedestrians. Our cops are hand-cuffed to the extent that criminals have more rights than potential victims.<br/><br/>Both of these guys are lousy, political opportunists catering to the left. The glory days of NYC are past. "
339,Metro,"""Even before the election, Mr. Cuomo had told Mr. de Blasio raising taxes was a nonstarter given Republican control of the State Senate,"" -- Republican control of the Senate was something totally engineered by phony Dem Cuomo himself."
340,Metro,"Maybe The Real Estate Board of New York can arrange a truce. After all, both these guys are on the payroll."
341,Metro,"Very interesting article. But back in the day, the NY Times and other media would always join ""radical"" and ""feminist"" together as if they were one word. Why is Mayor DeBlasio an ""unrepentant liberal?"" What do liberals have to repent for? I never, ever, see the word ""conservative"" conjoined with ""unrepentant"" or any other pejorative term. Please just call a liberal a liberal."
342,Metro,They are both cut from the same fourth rate rags. 
343,Metro,"I hope Andrew Cuomo will read this comment section and realize that most New Yorkers accurately lay the responsibility at his feet.<br/><br/>His corruption and his arrogance are boundless, and we've got his number.<br/><br/>Give it up, Andy. You're NEVER going to be President. Go clean up your mess."
344,Metro,"This battle of egos is so in fortunate, we are electing those men for a big job and didn't foresee that they won't have the confidence to let their egos behind them , it also tells me that they cannot t run for higher office if they are both so little and can only fight in the playground, after reading this article I think the biggest loss was that at one moment we the voters could have put the bickering behind us if they could join force and working on Rikers island and the penal system , bond , etc, etc, that being said we may end up with a Republican governor that will be the result of their behavior, one thing that I am sure is that i cannot vote for Cuomo after what he made all of us endure in NYC subway , he demonstrated poor leadership , only because of the campaign finances contributions from Union, what we have left as citizens is the right to vote , electoral college won't obsolete my vote and I am intending one of the last privilege."
345,Metro,Each is right in his assessment of the other. 
346,Metro,"âFor 40 years, Cuomo has consistently said that the prior generation of Democrats focused too much on poetry and not enough on the prose of governing,â said Jon J. Cowan, Mr. Cuomoâs chief of staff at HUD.""<br/><br/>Aye, there's the rub.  It was Andrew's father who stated that one campaigns in poetry but governs in prose. In savaging the Mayor, Cuomo is really punishing his father who, while an articulate and passionate liberal, generally failed in his most visionary efforts.  <br/><br/>Andrew, Do all of us a favor. Get therapy. "
347,Metro,"The comments and coverage smell unfortunately reminiscent of the ""balanced"" coverage of Trump and Clinton during the campaign, when stories of all his pernicious behaviors were countered with ""but her server.""  From my perspective, De Blasio has been trying to serve NYC, and Cuomo has been countering him for self-serving political reasons from the get-go.  Yes, it'd be nice if De Blasio were more politically savvy and flexible, but it seems to me Cuomo would be spinning the narrative in his own favor no matter what.  The bottom line is that Cuomo -- from property taxes to Education -- has been serving moneyed interests for virtually his entire Governorship.  De Blasio's mayoralty has been pushing him to actually give more than lip service to being a Democrat, and Cuomo seems desperate to take him down."
348,Metro,"I think of these guys not as alpha males, but as something like beta-plus dudes who will never be secure or confident enough to be truly great leaders.  Neither can fully take over the tribe without constantly feeling threatened (like DJT), and so they flail in an effort to look larger and more imposing.  But, even with all their jumping and noise it is clear to everyone (and to themselves) that a true leader could just walk right in and take their power in an instant.<br/><br/>The democratic leadership is filled with guys like this.  When Obama came in it was so clear that he was the alpha that not even the HIllary machine could slow him down.  That is what a leader looks like.  these two NYers have two of the most powerful and most important political jobs in the country and they are still, somehow, insecure about their leadership.  Its nearly Shakespearean in its tragedy.<br/><br/>Ms. Nixon seems to care not a bit about upstate NYers, and exhibits no true leadership either.  She's not a plausible choice and so we will be stuck with the fall-out of these two ""leaders"" quarrel for the foreseeable future."
349,Metro,"You two elected officials, just do your jobs and spare us all this drama."
350,Metro,"âThose who have worked closely with the younger Mr. Cuomo over the years say he has a zero-sum approach to power, especially among Democrats in New York: The more anyone else has of it, the less there is for him.â<br/><br/>Thatâs all that needs to be said."
351,Metro,"I grew up in Queens and now live and teach in Raleigh and teach here (Chapel Hill). In NC one can have a civil conversation about politics and policies, with people of a variety of views.  I am a centrist independent and support less foreign military intervention, the ACLU, Planned parenthood, gay marriage, the Second Amendment and NRA, much more taxpayer spending on education, health and support of in-need children, but a bit less on adults. I see immigration as healthy, but disagree with open illegal immigration and constant amnesties. This puts me right in the middle, but where the left extreme 10% and right extreme 10% can't stand some my views. In NYC I'd have 100% disagreeing with me, but also being vitriolic and uncivil.  <br/><br/>NY is dynamic and simply the most interesting place on earth -- but  governance is pure zero sum, short cited and full of the nastiest politicians one can find. This is not an irony of the one party control there -- but a *natural outcome* as within the one party the fighting becomes more personal due to very little difference in policy outlooks."
352,Metro,"He feuds with Schneiderman too.  And he can't seem to switch to a more proper mode to campaign against Nixon, even though she isn't a serious threat.  Charming he ain't.  His dad seems to have gotten all the charm."
353,Metro,"<br/>""Both men . . . have dropped any pretense of cordiality, sniping at each other on Twitter and in interviews . . . Mr. Cuomo and Mr. de Blasio both declined to speak on the record.""<br/><br/>Isn't the political world in enough shambles as it is with Trump at the helm without these two knuckleheads adding to it with their despicable, distasteful, and disgusting public behavior?  Geez, these guys can't even keep their messaging straight - declining to speak on the record yet tapping and twitting on Twitter like there's no tomorrow.<br/><br/>If I didn't know better, I would swear both ""gentlemen"" are Republicans cloaked in Democratic duds.  They seem more enthralled and focused on themselves than the wonderful folks of New York City and the state of New York.  They should be voted out because they don't appreciate, deserve nor value the folks who voted them in to begin with.  "
354,Metro,"Both of them are Democrats and arguably progressive in their own unique ways. Both of them are arrogant, stubborn and full of themselves. Neither of them deliver on the majority of their promises, both can be bought and sway in the wind as their massive egos dictate.<br/>However, while I dislike them both, Cuomo is smart, has solid instincts and â for better or worse - gets things done. He is a classic deal-cutting politician who understands itâs all about moving the ball down the field. DeBlasio has a record of getting almost nothing on the other hand except screwing up everything he embraces. In a word, he is incompetent yet travels around masquerading as a viable candidate for some higher office. Go figure."
355,Metro,"Both of these men are more concerned about their future political lives and they use their current offices only to bolster their political careers. While they are both are fault, I find it truly amazing how deBlasio travels around the country and the world espousing his progressive views while the City suffers from his neglect and his antagonistic attitudes toward Cuomo. Whether he likes it or not, the State has always had certain powers to control various functions of the City and he has a responsibility to work with the Governor to get for the City that which it needs. But, his arrogance and stupidity get in his way all the time. While both of these men are acting childish, at least the State of NY is benefitting under Cuomo, the same cannot be said for the City of NY under deBlasio. "
356,Metro,"I can think of no politician more obnoxious that Cuomo. <br/><br/>He put up a needless replacement for the Tappan Zee Bridge instead of fixing the old one, (which is what is done with all the other bridges when they need work),  so he could name it after his father; he caused the mortgage crises which erupted ten years ago because of his policies at HUD when he was Bill Clinton's HUD secretary; he came up the the slogan ""vote for Cuomo not the homo"" when his daddy ran against Ed Koch in a mayoral primary in 1977; he's currently running those ""I Love NY"" commercials, which are really Cuomo campaign ads, all over local TV at taxpayer expense; currently  he's moaning and groaning about NYCHA and got the TWU to run radio ads touting his funding of subway repairs which the State owns and which the State should have been taking care of all along. All of this is on the eve of the election. <br/><br/>Where has he been for the last seven years?<br/><br/>Is it any wonder that I like to refer to him as ""il Duce""?"
357,Metro,"As Mayor/Governor I'd want a full accounting and complete overhaul of the corrupt MTA. Every year it seems another rate hike where does all the money go?<br/><br/>The re-naming of the Tappan-Zee Bridge (a mix of Dutch and Native American) to his Daddy? The unmitigated gall.<br/><br/>His bullying ways (both of them)<br/><br/>His never being on time for anything ad not wanting to answer questions posed to him (de Blasio)<br/><br/>Both have been in the public sector their entire lives, both have gotten greedy, both are liars and care little about the citizens that put them in office save their top donors leaves me cold.

Nixon got a tremendous bump in approval when Kissinger stated ""peace is at hand"" in 1972 in Vietnam.<br/><br/>As the North Vietnamese were well aware of the US political situation during Paris negotiations so are Xi and Kim of current US political climate.

366,OpEd,"I missed the news of Uwe Reinhardtâs passing, but I can whole-heartedly agree with everything that Paul Krugman said about him. As an undergraduate at Princeton, the first course in economics I took was one that was assigned to me without my initial agreement. What? Economics? Iâm an engineer! I took the course anyway, and I am very glad I did. It was an introductory course taught by Uwe Reinhardt. He was funny. He was informative. He was smart. I made sure to take several more courses of his. He even made accounting interesting!<br/><br/>And, as Paul Krugman said, he was a very kind man. Once, about 7-8 years after graduating, I saw him on an Amtrak train coming back fro Washington. I went up to him and spoke briefly. He remembered my face, but not my name.

371,Metropolitan,"Surely we cannot change the facts of history, nor ought we to destroy the pyramids and change the names of our cities named Jefferson and Washington. And why change the names of Georgetown and Brown  Universities honoring slaveowners? Itâs a political decision, clearly in any case, something that the Native Tribes must have thought when the colonists started calling Manhattan âNew York City.â<br/>President Donald Trump, for instance, greatly admires President Andrew Jackson who committed ethnic cleansing of Native Americans from the eastern United States. And he objects to former slave Hariett Tubman replacing Jackson. Should we blame Trump for admiring Jackson or Obama for his feckless effort to put a black personâs image  on our currency?<br/>Slaves have no rights in any society, but black female slaves under racist American slavery had no rights to decide what any white person could do to them. As Justice Roger Taney wrote defending the Supreme Courtâs Dred Scott decision that helped launch our Civil War,  âA black slave has no rights that any white person need respect.â<br/>Well, Justice Taney was wrong. Now the descendants of the victors in the Civil War that reversed Taneyâs decision have demonstrated that whites like Sims have no right to be honored. Our next election will decide whether we continue to honor Jacksonâs image on our currency. Itâs a political decision either way. Vote!"
372,Metropolitan,I believe I read where Dr. Sims performed many of his experiments on slaves without anesthesia as well.   I think the statue should be melted down and remade into something to honor the agony and suffering of his forgotten victims.  America has too few reminders and virtually no monuments to the men and women murdered by slavery and slave transport.
373,Metropolitan,"I find it interesting that it was women in general, no matter their race or class, and the unique suffering they endured as a function of their biology that seems to have determined whether or not anesthesia was worth the trouble. The male medical anthropologist seems to be saying, ""hey, there's no problem here because even white women were denied anesthesia."" <br/><br/>He further mansplains that the women were already in so much pain that they welcomed more pain in exchange for possible, though not guaranteed, relief. Was that the same standard applied to men who were also already suffering tremendously? The overwhelming implicitly male bias that's pervaded medicine and scientific research throughout history leads me to believe not.<br/><br/>More than simply racist, the statue ""celebrates"" the rampant institutional sexism and flat-out cruelty women of all colors had to endure throughout the 19th Century. And, of course, it continues today though through far more subtle and unconcious means such as this rationalized mansplanation of the relative values of the degrees of female pain. "
374,Metropolitan,"If we can face our our history, all of it, we see that many  highly honored men have dark sides. Likewise, many noble causes have ignoble elements. This plays against the impulse to create pure heroes and villains - a human, tribal impulse.<br/><br/>Keeping some ""monuments"" intact but in museum-like settings where a complete picture of a person's acts is incorporated into the display encourages wider understanding of the issues. Smashing a statue, relegating it to dust - might be satisfying in the moment, but doesnât challenge people to think deeply.<br/><br/>No doubt Sims held both racist and sexist views - like his peers. For enslaved women to be forced to have surgery is horrible, but might it have been a last resort for life without the serious problems caused by the fistulas? Nuanced, as you say.<br/><br/>Most of us have benefited from medical knowledge gained at the expense of others who had no choices or were misused. The public argument about the statue created unease, and interest in this history, and in those women, to whom we owe thanks.<br/><br/>Historical distance does matter. If we destroy a symbol - the evidence - future generations will not have a chance to judge for themselves. Thinking in general terms, not specific to the Sims controversy - there can be utter fury at an individual from partial or misinformation. <br/><br/>Ancient Buddhist statues were blown up because they offended Taliban beliefs.  We are not locked into a need to destroy all that we find offensive - we can use it to teach."
375,Metropolitan,"""The arts commission that voted to remove the statue from its original site had all of this information â they had the nuanced story, but they decided the statue needed to be taken down regardless.""  Why? Did they feel they just had to take down at least one statue?  Didn't the facts matter.  The original piece and what attempt to pass as a rationalization is just political correctness pure and simple. Admittedly, unlike slavery in the U.S.  there is no historical proof of Jewish enslavement in Egypt, but just for the sake of argument,  who determined that Jews have timed out on repercussions by historical distance.

He was an ill-trained outlier and controversial among many of his peers even in the evil context of slavery. Many thought he went/had gone too far. He experimented with operations on infants for which he had no training and only a hunch. He took unjustifiable risks because he had access to slaves and admitted he would could not perform his experiments on white people. So, try and understand that you, in 2018, are making excuses for horrendous medical abuses, that even the racist physicians of the time took issue with."

390,Editorial,"As a retired addictions professional ( LCADC; LCSW) who watched this rolling crisis worsen over the last 15 years, I think one answer is to require ALL MDâs and students in our Med schools to take at least one and maybe two courses approved by the American Society of Addictions Medicine to at minimum get the basics on recognizing and addressing addictions when encountering it it their daily professional lives. Addiction to substances is a brain disease with predictable symptoms. ..There are effective ways To treat it, as well as avoiding being part of the problem by prescribing opiates without sufficient knowledge. Finally, we need to commit to â treatment on demandâ as a society, and recognize that people donât get dependent on drugs because they want to."
391,Editorial,"The death toll from opiate abuse is the tip of the iceberg. The inability to work, the poor quality of life and the increased medical morbidity really take a toll on addicts. Thus, switching individuals over to Buprenorphine or Suboxone (Buprenorphine with Naloxone) does absolutely nothing for all of the above morbidities. These substances are still very addictive drugs that patients have a very difficult time weaning from and yes you can die when these drug are mixed with alcohol or sleeping pills. How do we reduce opioid addition problems plaguing our country? Teens must be educated about the dangers in the classroom every year. How many mg are safe? What happens when mixed with alcohol or benzodiazepines? How can you be certain the tablet of Percocet you are handed at a party is not laced with heroin? People getting drivers licenses should also have a mandatory 15 minute video on opiate addiction and driving issues. Doctors should hand out no more than 10 pills at a time for procedures. For most procedures in most patients non-steroidal are actually better pain killers. Patients needing more narcotics beyond the initial 10 would have to receive additional pills from a pain specialist. Finally non FDA synthesis and distribution must be made a far far higher penalty crime and one for which the penalties of those caught are regularly broadcasted. "
392,Editorial,"Indeed, opioid addiction is a serious public health problem.  But so is untreated pain, in both patients with terminal illness and in patients with chronic pain syndromes.  Like the opioid epidemic, chronic pain syndromes and pain associated with life limiting illness are not simple issues.  Whatever policy and legislative efforts are made to address our opioid overdose epidemic also need to insure access to opioid pain medications for those patients who are using them responsibly under a physician's close supervision for management of chronic or cancer pain."

394,Editorial,"It has been impossible to get any respectable news source to address the impact this is having on patients who have incurable severe chronic pain. They need pain medication to just exist. They would give anything to not need this yet they are punished because they have no other option. This is not impossible to solve. These patients are thoroughly documented and monitored. The doctor and pharmacy, to feel safe, must drug test these patients. Theyâre followed closely by their doctor. They make 2 trips a month (at least) to get their monthly medication. There are fewer doctors and pharmacies available because itâs stressful for them as well. Any doctor or pharmacy can see the medication they are using. My spouse is having his medication reduced only to protect the doctor. In the past few years itâs been reduced twice and his mobility and quality of life is going backwards. He was able to participate and feel useful in life to a degree and now heâs back to feeling hopeless and and a burden. To protect who? He doesnât contribute to the addiction problems of others. It is just laziness of the politicians and the media to leave them out of this conversation completely.

However, the dreadful state of regulation also includes the massive exposure of children in Flint to a known and heavily regulated neurotoxicant. Federal and state laws make it very hard to regulate, given the need of chemical manufacturers to put their profits ahead of child safety. Even the most obvious cases, such as removing lead from gasoline, involved endless wrangling, how are we going to protect high compression auto engines from something that everyone was sure caused insidious loss of IQ. I feel like many who do not want to battle endlessly about how desperately we need toxic  fire suppressants that are getting into well water.

News stories like this are the last bastion between us and total government corruption."
410,Investigative,"Pruitt, as odious as he may be, is not the problem. Neither is Trump, the consummate Republican; a lying crook. The problem is the Republican Party, an organized crime cabal impersonating a political party, which should be prosecuted under the RICO statutes if not for outright treason. They are just thieves in business suits, stooges for the NRA and the Koch Brothers and anti democratic crypto fascists who will do anything to hold unto power up to and including violence. They'd show up in jackboots and armbands if the optics weren't so bad. We want these criminals thrown out in November and then: no more forgive and forget, no more reach across the aisles, no more bipartisan nonsense. We don't want the Republican Party to reform: we want it to END. And we want Republican criminals in jail, behind bars where most of them have long belonged. "
411,Investigative,"As the republic is collapsing, why not grab as much as you can as soon as you can?  No wonder this bum has such a large security detail.  "
412,Investigative,Republicans and the right wing media can only dream of this level of graft and corruption in a Democratic administration. What is it about the GOP and corruption? It is the only thing they excel at!
413,Investigative,"I believe that people are confused about what Trump meant by âDrain the swampâ.  He meant to get rid of most entities like the EPA, Interior, Energy, etc by putting those opposed to the existence of these departments in charge of gutting their size, stunting their mission, and otherwise negating their effect.  THATâS the swamp he meant.  NOT the ethical swamp.<br/>Look at whoâs in charge of these departments:<br/>Pruitt, Zinke, Perry. "
414,Investigative,"How is this different than what Putin is doing in Russia with his oligarchs?  It looks as corrupt to me.  However, the Oklahoma voters endorsed Pruitt for the Oklahoma State Attorney General job.  From this, one concludes that the voters were either ill informed (victims of fake news), or content with a government and its politicians manipulating laws concerning money, how it is made, and who benefits.  <br/><br/>This is what the American people endorsed in November of 2016 when they elected Donald Trump.  What swamp is Donald Trump going to clean up?  Pruitt and his associated look like a toxic dump site."
415,Investigative,"The planet earth, this county, you and I and need Pruitt  to go. Anyone who thinks he has any value other than Trump and company mindless personal gain, is a fool. "
416,Investigative,This is what is wrong with the entire GOP supporters and leaders.  They are the 1 percent who are doing well in capitalism.  They don't know what a loaf of bread or a gallon of milk costs like the rest of us.  Then they put tariffs on many items we the 99 percent are already struggling for in our daily budget .  When are those dumb GOP supporters who are not wealthy like the farmers going to stop voting for the rich to be President.  How did you like your 1 month tax break for workers? Now the gas on the east coast is going to be 2.70 a gallon and over 4.00 in California.  Trump knows how to be a con man in every law he makes.
417,Investigative,Pruitt and his buddies are now and have always been criminals and grifters.   Of course they'd be brought to DC by Trump -- another grifter and criminal who has used other people's money over the years and defrauded people whenever possible.<br/>These criminals cannot be removed from Washington fast enough.

"
422,Investigative,I'd like to think this guy us an anomaly. That this whole administration is an anomaly. I just can't think that anymore.
423,Investigative,The worst is that Trump makes Pruitt look like a newbie. I think Pruitt should be fired but with a spineless and hypocritical GOP Congress chances are very slim.<br/>Trump should be called to account for the money he has made since taking office too. I would not be surprised if Trump is conducting insider trading deals just like his other swamp friend Carl Ichan.<br/>This administration is bleeding the treasury dry and making side deals for personal investment like never before. Jason Chaffetz had to leave because he knew he wouldn't be able to bring himself to investigate fellow Republicans and Benghazi Gowdy just looks the other way.
424,Investigative,"Even in the swamp world that Trump &amp; Pruitt swim in the quid pro quo between Pruitt and his lobbyist and business buddies is extraordinarily blatant. Reminds one of the type of corruption practiced in petro states, like Saudi Arabia or perhaps Oklahoma? "
425,Investigative,"Pruitt Pruitt seems to be one of those individuals who is corrupt by birth.  His sense of entitlement and his utter lack of ethics and respect for the law is so blatant and consistent that his mommy and daddy must have trained him that way.  He is very similar to Trump in that way, which is no doubt why Trump cleaves to him so ardently.  They both have no shame."
426,Investigative,"Rachel Maddow had a great expose on Pruitt's 1st class trip to Morocco in 2017. Pruitt took many of the Oklahoma Frackternity brothers he has on EPA payroll, including Kenneth Wagner. The official EPA junket visited with Moroccan officials and Pruitt had a sales pitch for liquified natural gas exports from Cheniere Energy, the only US LNG export terminal. Cheniere is owned by Carl Icahn, who recommended Pruitt to Trump who appointment Pruitt to head the EPA . Cheniere Energy is marketed and lobbied by Williams and Jensen, whose CEO Steven Hart rented Pruitt the famous $50 a night room.<br/><br/>Pruitt's trip to Morocco was first class and billed to EPA. The trip included a 2-night stopover in Paris, first-class all the way for team EPA. No reason given for Paris interlude. No EPA business discussed in Morocco, just the Cheniere LNG export sales pitch. Payback for Carl Icahn getting Pruitt his job? This trip is a criminal act. Charge Pruitt now!"

429,Investigative,Let Trump leave Pruitt in place.  Come mid-terms this will be some nice ammunition for democrats to utilize in their campaign advertisements regarding how successful Trump has been at  âdraining the swampâ. 
430,Investigative,"Now that ""The New York Times"" has shed all this light onto the nefarious doings of Mr. Pruitt, it seems logical that the next step is President Trump's announcement that Mr. Pruitt has been fired from his post as the EPA Administrator.  President Trump has done a wonderful of employing Administration personnel who, after the fact, turn out to be of very questionable character.<br/><br/>This method allows President Trump to drain and clear the swamp of national politics by bringing bad actors to Washington, D.C. where they are exposed for being the ne're do wells that they really are.  It is an ingenious method by which President Trump can keep his hands relatively clean and clear of the toxicity of these people while in effect removing them from the national scene.  In effect President atrump has created his own personnel Superfund Program for the removal of toxic waste.  The bases will soon be cleared of Mr. Pruitt and his mid-country cronies.  Minor leaguers indeed!     "

This is not to say that doulas might not be helpful; however, pretty much anyone can call herself a doula, so it's hard to judge a doula's qualifications and quality. Instead of paying to add another layer of health care providers with uncertain qualifications and experience (doulas), it would seem more cost-effective to use the extra funds to improve standards and performance in the under-performing hospitals that have high rates of birth-related problems for women of all races and backgrounds.<br/><br/>By the way, the term ""doula"" is based on the Greek for ""female servant,"" and was coined in 1969 by Dr. Dana Raphael, an American anthropologist noted for her promotion of breast-feeding (as opposed to use of formula)."

The long history of white and black racism a form still highly visible must be taken into consideration - somehow.<br/><br/>Here is what is always missing.

It's always about the appearance of correctness (political or otherwise).  It has no real compassion or understanding to it.  <br/><br/>And it's condescending as all hell.  <br/><br/>And as the saying goes, ""You can't condescend up.""  Implicit in it all is the assumption that 'white' people, having no such vulnerable spots, are still better and stronger than everyone else.  <br/><br/> Attacking the words alone does nothing but make the ideas behind them stronger.

488,Culture,"This tempest-in-a-teapot is one more attempt to completely bland out our entire culture.<br/><br/>How about we get rid of all culture - no music, no theater, no museums, no books, no movies and CERTAINLY no TV - b/c something might possibly offend someone.<br/><br/>We have so many people around whose lives revolve around finding something to be offended by - it's like a perverse hobby for people with nothing better to do.

490,Culture,"Does eliminating the ""gypsy robe"" mean that when I walk down Ninth Avenue I'll no longer have to see big, metal signs for âpsychicsâ illegally chained to lampposts in the corner quadrants? At some point, self-preservation and the uplifting of an ethnic or religious group really has to come from within. Jews still go to the theatre and suffer through Fagin and Shylock, but I donât think there are any plans for the characters to be eliminated from Dickens or Shakespeare, even when performed in Israel. There are clearly times when sensitivity is important, and times when language becomes an excuse to ignore real problems and current issues. The root of the word gypsy (with a lower case ""g"") becomes irrelevant when the issues around Roma are so huge, current, and prevalent. At the turn of the previous century, the NYPD Italian Squad was comprised of Italian immigrant Detectives working to eliminated the crimes of the Black Hand and the Mafia on the lower east side. The NYPD Gypsy Squad of the 1940s and â50s, however, was not comprised of Roma Detectives. Iâd be hard pressed to locate any today. Actors Equity can cave in all it wants, but when some down and out actor loses his last buck to the desperation of a Hells' Kitchen tarot card, can he come crying to you for help? At what point do the real issues surrounding Roma kick in, and not the crutch of âthe slur made me do it?â "
491,Culture,"@Sam - just to clarify, are you arguing that it's ok to use ethnic slurs, as long as your understanding of an entire ethnicity is limited to the crimes or bad behavior committed by some within it? <br/><br/>Of course change needs to come from within. Of course we have our own issues to deal with - and as has been said repeatedly, this is not the biggest battle we face (clearly, since your entire awareness of us seems to be Tarot readers who are probably not Roma anyway). <br/><br/>None of that excuses bad behavior by you all in return. <br/><br/>And believe me, we are not using this to deflect from the challenges we already face. Most of us who are involved in activism for the community deal primarily with issues related to education, health care, food security, fair housing, and the like. Not just running around asking organizations who should know better, not to insult us, if they'd be so kind. This, I expect is mostly invisible to you. Just like the millions of Roma around the world, who go about their lives daily, as professionals, educators, health care workers, students - maybe sitting across from you in the office - afraid to even tell people they are Roma. Not knowing whether you'll clap with glee about stories of wagons and freedom, ask for your palm to be read, or scowl at the dirty gypsy and wonder to yourself if you need to watch your purse. <br/><br/>Please check your own assumptions. Know your own biases. Our people share tragedies - let's not compound them. L  "
492,Culture,"The ""other meaning"" for Gypsy COMES from the ethnicity. Not the other way around. And many of the other slurs for other groups did have common meanings, we just have stopped using them. "
493,Culture,"@L - There have been coordinated and consistent outcry at the TLC series, as well as the British versions, within our community. As for why some in our community did the show in the first place - in many cases, those were Irish travelers, not Roma, and there will always be someone who wants to be on the stage, or needs the money."

500,Washington,Trump is a despicable human being.  However the problem is not Trump or even the spineless Republican leadership. The core problem is that many many of our fellow citizens want a man like Trump to be their president. The very things that we find so abhorrent are the very things that Trumpersters admire and are drawn to. Unfortunately I fear that all the sleeze and sewage that will be revealed won't change the mind of one trumpster. Therefore the only course of action that can have any impact is at the ballot box. 
501,Washington,"Hope for impeachment is useless. The GOP would most likely not bring it, and his base would make him a martyr.<br/><br/>What would be true justice is if there are criminal acts related to payoffs to women, and/or the organization's business dealings in N.Y."

503,Washington,"i believe our president has never been truly told NO regarding anything he wanted.  to go through life and never face repercussions for any act committed has left him in the most unreal bubble.  Cohen may have been willing to take a bullet in the past, but finding himself looking up at  the sky from under the bus may just put a different spin on what he thinks loyalty is.  the 'president is going to face all kinds of adult issues soon.  not soon enough because the next election will seal his future.  hey i can hope."

508,Washington,I and thousands of others saw the police murder Eric Garner.  He had been constantly harassed by the police for standing around while black for a long time.

510,OpEd,"Your apology sounds sincere, but as we know from celebrity and corporate apologies that have flooded the airwaves in the past few years, sincerity is not enough.  For an apology to be accepted, and few are, it needs to convey a genuine sense of contrition, and a promise of atonement.  That atonement must be commensurate with the enormity of the transgression.  We are now living with Donald Trump as our president.  What will you do to make that right?  We will see what the future brings, but for now you, and the entire New York Times, remain on the wrong side of history.  Apology not accepted.  Not yet."

I was born in Manhattan, lived there most of my life except spending my formative years (7-17 in Europe).  I sold my apartment this year and I now live with in the Swiss Alps and own an apartment in Milan.  My two payments are still half of what I spent in the the city for my small 2 bedroom.

The landlords didn't care since they could not rent it for any more money.<br/><br/>Now all that has changed. If you are in a rent controlled/stabilized apt., you have a bulls eye target on your block since landlords can get much more rent than you are paying and will do everybody possible to legally make sure you are  legally there and follow the rules. Also when you leave they will finagle with the repairs to make sure that can jack up the rent to where it becomes decontrolled.<br/><br/>Not only this, even if you follow the rules, many will illegally harass you and try to get you out."

538,Well,"I had bypass surgery a year ago at age 76.   6 bypasses for extensive  coronary artery disease.  4 of the shunts failed within two months.   Two heart attacks followed, and some of the failed shunts needed to be opened with stents.  So you can now call me half hearted.  Prior to the cardiac diagnosis I suffered from A-fib for nearly 5 years without knowing it.  Periodic episodes  of fainting spells, without any other indicators. What sent me to my cardiologist  was vascular pain in my left arm during exercise, not the fainting spells.  I'm still above ground and recovering very slowly from the surgery.  So my advice to all is to make sure you know the symptoms of A-fib  and to exercise regularly and get your heart rate up, at any discomfort or pain get thee to a cardiologist.  "
539,Well,"A woman I know has a 65 yr.old sister that woman plus her husband (also 65) were just diagnosed with congestive heart disease.  The 65 yr. old wife is now in a hospital on suicide watch.  Getting old is not easy.  Take care of yourself: get tests, do not smoke, no alcohol is best, and keep exercising and rid yourself of that fat.  It will eventually kill you as it will do to this woman."
540,Well,"Of course one can miss the signs; my ex-husband, a physician, attributed his palpitations, chest pain and lightheadedness to dehydration. He ultimately died after a second heart attack."
541,Metro,"Shameful that New York City still allows plastic bags when other progressive cities around the country have banned them. Some grocery stores such as Fairway donât even have a paper option! Once they are banned, people start bringing their own bags. Not a hard cultural habit to break.

542,Well,"What an inspirational and moving article! Thank you for expressing so eloquently what true partnership, trust, and letting go feels like. I hope this article inspires other people to find that within themselves and their relationships.  "
543,Well,"What a wonderful story! I've been married 45 years.  When we first married we crossed the ""divorce"" out of the dictionary, and that act alone got us through the first 12 years which were rough. One friend advised, ""If he's not abusive and isn't an alcoholic, try to work it out."" Marriage Encounter taught us how to communicate. Now we're best friends, and my biggest fear is that he will die somehow and leave me alone."
544,Well,the word Dreams keeps coming up in these comments.  What dreams?  You need to watch the movie Mr. Nobody.  Or read some Eckart Tolle.  Life is not out there where you are not.  Its inside of you.   I feel sorry for all the men that have to put up with this nonesense.  You dreamed first that you could work in a skyscraper doing fancy finance.  then you realized its just a job.   Dreams are built by a team.  If the guy is 150k behind then you put down 75k and he does and you make move TOGETHER.  Dont just sit there and cry and cause him pain.  Be the light you want to see in the world.   he certainly knew this motto
545,Well,"It is eerie how resonant this story is for me...and perhaps for many others. I am a South Florida native who returned after years away for love--and since the timing (and locale) was at the apex of the real estate bubble, we ended up fairly deep in the suburbs as it was all we could afford. Freeways and horrific traffic lie between our neighborhood and the few walkable areas in the region, and as for hikes, a walk along a paved path in the steamy Everglades is pretty much it. I have long had a hankering for an elusive ideal of city life, as Lauren describes; it is hard for me to visit any wonderful city in the U.S. or abroad without fantasizing about moving there. And yet, for the time being, here I am. My sweetheart is very loyal, very steady, and completely uninterested in imagining life in other settings. But he is in more ways than I can count the air that I breathe, and I try very hard not to take that for granted."
546,Well,"Some people have a difficult time with change.  So, the fact that someone won't move doesn't necessarily mean they don't love their spouse or are selfish. It's just part of their basic persona to be rooted and for them, moving would feel like cutting off an arm.  This same personality trait can also make them completely committed to their family and very loving, caring spouses.  While it's miserable to live in a place you hate (for me, it's the midwest or south), a loving home really matters. And, finding cheap ways to travel can solve a lot of the problem.  "
547,Well,Beautiful!!
548,Well,I was raised in the suburbs and have a deep and abiding aversion to them even after leaving for the city 48 years ago. There really was nothing there..there.
549,Well,"Personally, I can't imagine marrying someone who was committed to living in a place I really disliked. That would have been a deal-breaker for me! Where you're going to live is one of the primary decisions a couple makes, and it has huge implications that reverberate in many ways."
550,Well,"My dad was a pipefitter.  My mother (she was 18 and he was 20 when they married) followed my dad for years.  A lot of the time it was just her taking care of my sister and I while my dad was in some location working. (At one point all 4 of us were living in a 23 ft travel trailer for 11 months so we could all be together)  Everytime he changed jobs my mom would have to quit a job, leave friends, and uproot her life again.  She did that no less than 20+ times.  She died when she was 53...just a few years before my dad was due to retire when they would finally be able to enjoy the retirement that my dad (and my mom too!) had accumulated.  All those moves, all that time...now my dad lives alone 20 minutes from the place where she died. She was his rock, our rock, and now she's gone.  It breaks my heart.  There were good times and bad times. I did learn something from my parents though.  Marriage is work. It's hard. It's not a fairy tale. My dad also told me that I needed to maintain my own life. Don't get wrapped up in him.  Good advice. "
551,Well,"Well, she has matured. She acknowledged at the end of the story how all she ever had to do was reach out for him all along.  Happy to have read this through, it is graceful encourgement for both parties to stay the course.  Marriage is forever."
552,Well,"How is that true? Honestly, that is creepy. Marriage should be a shared adventure, with intellectual, spiritual and sexual unity. And a lot of work thrown in. But that does not take away autonomy. By this reasoning, one is a parent to a spouse. Yuck, no thanks."
553,Well,Or maybe attempting to ruin your partner's credit by trying to get them to short sell property and getting into a marriage and not discussing/establishing where you want to live beforehand is something selfish and short-sighted. Crazy I know.
554,Well,"I didn't remember you also wrote ""bloom where you're planted"" as I was writing my response to you lol! I was so focused on New England and other similarities. It's a saying that brings peace in the soul, isn't it? Spring is coming, Boston -- hang in there!"
555,Well,"There is a while lot left out of this narrative.<br/>1) when you attend college in a location you would despise living in long term, you take your chances. Many meet their spouses in college.<br/>2) its not like the author DIDNT know where her husbands family resided, where he had grown up, where his job was.<br/>3) doubtlessly the husbands income is significantly larger than the authors.<br/>4) If you want to live in a tony left leaning neighborhood with good weather, you'd better get a business degree, be a programmer...its no mystery that living in upper easts side manhattan poor Greenwich village is too expensive for most freelance writers.<br/><br/>That said, I think anyone can and should sympathize with The authors  cancer experience and inability to have children. Thats a tragedy no matter where they live or who their spouse is. Saroyan and Thornton  WIlder wrote several books the author might find bring her some measure of peace about small town living."
556,Well,"1.  Real Estate need not rule.  People make the decision to allow it to do so.  Almost 5 million homes were repossessed during the crash.  Life goes on.  Sell the house at a loss and move on.<br/><br/>2.  True.<br/><br/>3.  Marginally true.  With or without kids, getting out of a relationship is difficult and painful for all involved.  Kids do make the prospect of moving considerably more difficult.<br/><br/>4.  Disagree.<br/><br/>5.  Read the last paragraph again.  Although, I do agree that the story was a bit of a downer.  Glad my marriage has always been much better and happier than the one she describes."

558,Well,"Many of California's 28 non-native Eucalyptus tree species are old growth because they are 80 or years older -- including the most typical species, Blue Gum Eucalyptus. At 150 to 200 feet, this metric and 80+ years qualifies as ""old growth."""
559,Well,"He wanted kids, he made sacrifices by staying with the woman he married who couldn't have kids. Pretty MASSIVE compromise that I find it hard to grasp how that Mount Rushmore-sized fact was missed."
560,OpEd,"Her son, not her. "
561,OpEd,"I totally disagree. The feelings of the audience, minority or otherwise, have no bearings on the right to free speech. Minority students have the right not to listen to a lecture they find offensive (and even this is debatable as the purpose of higher education is to open your minds to ideas you may disagree with). But they have no right to shut up a speaker whom they deem âracistâ precisely because in order to make such a determination, they have to listen first. In fact, there is no moral equivalence between shouting down somebody like Charles Murray, whose ideas, mistaken or not, are grounded in academic research, and denouncing the tasteless tweets about a dead woman. The tweets are morally reprehensible. The ideas are not. "

564,BookReview,"Albright's career shaped fascism for the 21st century. She was the leader of American nationalist exceptionalism that deemed the killing of children through the withholding of medicines acceptable. Albright is wrong about why fascism flourishes. Fascism becomes an alternative for the working classes when liberals betray them by aligning with capitalists to reverse social democratic policies transferring wealth from the top 1% to the bottom 80% of economic participants. Americans recently witnessed this phenomenon in November 2016, when a liberal presidential candidate who embraced finance capitalism and abuse of military might to expand national power was defeated by a demagogue, whose only real skill was pointing out the hypocrisy of liberals. Albright continues her fascist role by conflating an economic justice proponent like Chavez to an ethnic nationalist like Orban. Chavez fought the real enemies of Venezuela's people - its ruling elite. Albright cares more about protecting the assets of the top .01% of income earners than the rest of citizens, and she frames her concern as opposition to fascism. Condemn her for her Orwellian conceit.      "
565,BookReview,"""Democrats and Republicans must work together again to solve our countryâs problems â and Republicans must not allow the fervidness of Trumpâs supporters to blind them to the danger to democracy that he represents."" The ""fervidness of Trump's supporters"" is what Repubicans have been counting on to stay in power for over 30 years. It's the Republican Party that for partisan advantage reuses to ""work together"". The GOP divides the nation with bigotry, denies science, religion, seeks to disenfranchise millions of voters, attacks judges and the press, refuses to follow democratic norms, games senate rules to slash taxes on themselves and their plutocrat donors, slashes funding for public education, changes rules of compromise on SCOTUS appointments, all with the backing of their own radio/TV indoctrination and propaganda empire. Compromise has been a no man's land for the GOP since their slash and burn democracy insurrection started in the  90's. Trump, and the elements of fascism, are the end product of GOP strategy to maintain power at all costs. "

It is Trump who will be under extreme pressure to get a deal... it may be his last chance to survive as a president.

If you are looking for an explanation concerning anything in the Trump orbit, look for and follow the money! "
571,Foreign,"âIt was as if talking to a neighbor right next door.â<br/><br/>Now there's a thought! Turns out talking to your ""neighbors"" might actually be a way to learn how to coexist with them!"
572,Foreign,"Of course he doesn't need to test anymore. He has achieved his objective of becoming a nuclear power and all other tests can be easily computer modeled. Our dotard in chief will hail the statement, but in reality, Kim won. Feeling great again America?"
573,Foreign,"I would love to trust this at face value, but I can't.<br/>First, North Korean leaders through the years have not given us much reason to feel confident about their word.<br/>Second, it is inexplicable that they would make public such a concession before anticipated meetings with an American president.<br/>I hope my skepticism is wrong.  A peaceful North Korea just sounds too good to be true."
574,Foreign,So you believe Kim can be trusted at his word.  I thought folks from Tennessee were more skeptical than that.

Swallow any bad taste you may have about an opposing representative or senatorial candidate and vote in the next election. Elections have consequences! "
581,Climate,"Trump's buying National Park Ground to build resorts. Pruitt and his cronies are going to frack that land.

Did 45 pay his taxes this year; oh yea not yet...."
582,Climate,"The first Republican president said it best. Our government is (or should be) of the people, by the people, and for the people. Scott Pruitt makes a mockery of that principle by his behavior and his policies."
583,Climate,"It's heartbreaking to read these politicians celebrate ""Pruitt's job"" like he is actually doing something good. He is just working for corporations not for the country. It is so obvious. And then all these Republicans in charge of Environmental  Committees who are doing more harm to the environment. This is unbelievable!! It's like having an engineer doing a doctor's job: it will never work..<br/>I really hope they call it like it is: corruption, abuse of power. If they really wanted him out, they would have said it. The fact that he is still there after all these scandals, says a lot about Republicans.. November won't you come...."
584,Climate,"No concern about Pruitt's disastrous policies for our environment, just his spending habits that make Republicans look bad too their base, must be an election coming up."
585,Climate,"Pruitt was not in Congress, he was the Attorney General for the state of Oklahoma."

587,Metropolitan,"I was a newspaper boy for the Detroit News from 1938 to 1940.

593,Learning,"     The school definitely did not handle the situation with Lizzy in a kind or respectful manor. A lot of actions taken could have been much polite to Lizzy. I do not think this should have even been considered a dress code violation. She did not intend to show her body off in a sexual way; she was merely doing what was most comfortable for her, and I personally do not see why she should be punished for that. I do think this could be an example of discrimination based on sex. Girls often get dress coded because their outfits could be distracting to boys, however, we donât try to combat this issue by telling boys to stop sexualizing girls. We only tell the girls to cover up.  My school luckily has a very fair dress code, but lately some teachers have been getting girls in trouble for showing their shoulders, which I think ia absurd. Shoulders are not sexual in any way and in no way should be distracting to the boys. Yes, I do agree, girls and women everywhere are standing up and challenging long held social norms. "
594,Learning," If someone wants to wear a bra then let them, if they don't want to, then why should they have to? it's not a problem of distraction or embarrassment, it's a problem of making it a problem when it doesn't have to be one. My school's dress code is lenient, but every now and then heavier girls wearing the same thing as thinner girls get called out, or shamed in front of classmates. It's not the ""sexual"" or ""revealing"" manner in which these girls dress that is the problem, its the sexualizing itself. If you don't want to dress a certain way, then don't dress that way. But how does it really affect you if someone else chooses to dress that way? Let people make their own decisions, and stop trying to make THEIR choices for them based on an outdated social construct. "
595,Learning,"I think this whole situation could have been avoided if they would have given Lizzy a warning about public decency. Lizzy had a painful sunburn and she didn't wear the bra because of it. She wore a baggy sweatshirt to cover it and as evidenced by the article, the average individual can not even notice that she is not wearing a bra. Lizzy made an attempt to conceal the fact that she wasn't wearing a bra (which is not a rule in the dress code). How is one punished for something that is not even against the rules? "

610,Washington,Donald Trump ACTS like he is guilty.
611,Washington,"I have not heard about this. When Comey gives one copy of his memo to the FBI, is it placed, sealed and unopened, in a secured location to be opened if necessary at a later date?  I am curious, as I wonder, if unsealed and read memos could have an impact and an influence on others who read or knew of the memos (at that time). "
612,Washington,"   The proof of this rhetorical pudding is in James Comeyâs consistency. From his Congressional testimony and book to his interviews and memos, his narrative and its details have never wavered or changed. Moreover, they corroborate othersâ testimony and evidence and reaffirm the erratic, inconsistent and contradictory behavior and âcharacterâ of Trump on fullsome and frightening display everywhere.<br/>   Whether NBCâs Holt or Russian operatives Lavrov and Kislyak, Trump has openly bragged to them, on the record, that he fired Director Comey to relieve the pressure of the âRusher thingâ. Now he maintains precisely the opposite. In the end, Trumpâs tweeting and making it up as he goes along will succumb to the integrity, truth-telling and honor of, among others, Comey and Mueller. More importantly, in the end, this is a question of what kind of country are we, and what kind of country do we want to be?"
613,Washington,"The Muller team did not say Trump was not a target ""last week."" Last week, it said he wasn't a target. It did not say Trump was no longer a target. What this means is that Trump is not a target of the Muller investigation. "
614,Weekend,Diana Rigg...'the definition of luxury casting'...I concur (and I haven't even seen the show).
615,Weekend,"Why do you gushingly praise a musical that has ""updated"" by bringing it closer to its original source? A modern audience should have no problem with Eliza slamming the door -- if Higgins' personality and motivations have been properly conveyed prior to that.<br/><br/>The writer is right about one thing -- the songs are bland and banal, verging on the vapid. G&amp;$, Ashman/Menken, and Frank Loesser wrote ""better"" songs that are a lot more fun to sing (eg. the Jack Point/Shadbolt duet in which they explain how they shot the escaping prisoner). Indeed, though operettas (like musicals) are usually lightweight affairs with (generally) happy endings, ""Yeomen of the Guard"" has an overall nastiness about it and a sour ending quite untypical of the genre."
616,Weekend,"We saw the first night of previews on March 15. This is a ravishing show that recalls a bygone era of glorious sets, costumes and music.  Upon entering the theater, one beholds a magnificent mural of London, circa 1900. Already the mood is set that we're in for something special. For the ballroom scene, the pit orchestra has been brought on stage to be the orchestra playing at the ball.  Marvelous!  Mr. Butz, as Eliza's dad, brought the house down with his antics in ""With a Little Bit of Luck,"" and ""Get Me to the Church On Time."" The ensemble is sublime. Listen for the barbershop harmony in ""Wouldn't it Be Loverly."" I also loved Higgins' butler who has a brief scene announcing Mr. Doolittle, and did it to a T.  Mrs. Pearce is a hoot saying so much with just a few words. This show lifts the spirits and sends the audience out with smiles. What could be better than that?!"
617,Weekend,"I saw MFL last week and thought it was OK, with the major disappointment being Lauren Ambrose.  I thought her acting inconsistent, and she had no chemistry with pretty much anyone she shared the stage with. For example, in the ""Wouldn't It be Loverly"" number, she didn't seem to have a connection with anyone else on stage. Since one of her challenges after her growth is to figure out where she fits in, unless the audience believes she has a life before she came to Higgins, it's not a big deal if she feels she can't go back. There was also no connection between her and Higgins (so who cares if they get along, or don't), or even between her and Pickering (when he is sad that she's gone, I was surprised since he show any concern for her while she was under Higgins' instruction), or her and Mrs. Pearce (she seems initially to be concerned about Eliza's well-being, but Eliza then didn't ever turn to her).  As for her singing, I thought Ms. Ambrose was behind on almost all her songs, and I have to admit that I just didn't personally like the tone of her voice and I thought her voice was quite harsh and cold, but that's just my preference.  When I think how good someone like Sierra Boggess or Laura Osnes could have been in that role, I wonder why Mr. Sher went with her.   Finally, I didn't understand the end - why have Eliza walk out through the audience (when the rest of the show didn't break that wall) instead of through the door?  Confusing."
618,Weekend,"Do we really need MY FAIR LADY to give us a ""lesson"" on female empowerment?  Why does EVERYTHING have to be shoved through a PC filter?<br/>The new ending is terrible.  I was at the press performance and the audience was clearly confused and dissatisfied."
619,Weekend,"Amazing that these revivals are sparking these incredible and at timse heated discussions.  It must be tough on the comment moderators trying to do their jobs, but I would wager that theater historians will be grateful for all this discussion of Broadway theater in what's becoming a nation-changing era.  How great that the Times has been opening up more theatre articles to reader comments, and it seems even leaving them open longer."
620,Weekend,"You'd think feminism had been invented this year, judging from this review. The trivialization of it, and its reduction to ""Me Too"" has caused social critics to see everything through that lens. But Shaw was a feminist, and this musical always had a strong feminist and social-critical theme. It's always there. Some productions seize on it, others don't, and the lovely music tends to soften all the blows. I haven't seen this production yet, but the review is untrustworthy because advance publicity connected it to the ""Me Too"" movement leading perspectives down that road when there are so many other ways to look at this work - that's its gift. A pity reviewers can only glide along with what they're expected to see. And if she throws his slipper at him at the end, that's just more trivia."
621,Weekend,"I have one free day in late May during my semi-annual NYC visit. The review makes me want to see MFL, but the negative comments make me think maybe I should save my money and hope for a ticket to Colbertâs Late Show.  Because Iâve never seen a live stage production, Audrey Hepburn will always be the gold standard ... in this dawning age of Bitcoin."
622,Weekend,Disgraceful travesty of both the Shaw text and the Lerner and Loewe musical. The music director I worked with when I understudied Eliza decades ago in summer stock is fit to be tied; and rightly so. 
623,Weekend,I am thrilled that I decided to take a chance and grab tickets to this production.  I am very much looking forward to it.  I knew Mr. Butts years ago when he worked with Terri Hatcher and lived in a friend's house in Chicago--such a talent!  And I have been a Lauren Ambrose fan since watching her sublime performance in 6 Feet Under.  
624,Weekend,"This review could easily have been written for the 1957 touring company that I saw in Chicago.  Diane Todd played Eliza against Michael Evan's ""Higgins"" with all of the grace and strength possible considering the restrictions of her social status. By the end of the play, when she reenters Higgins Office and he makes his infamous ""Eliza, fetch me my slippers."" remark, we know that she has become his equal if not more.  I'm not sure what later productions did in their relationship, but the original touring company was easily a match of equals.   I also saw Rex Harrison reprise the role of Higgns in a later anniversary revival.  He easily portrayed a pretentious Higgins who was working very hard to cover his own insecurities. The misogynist songs of Higgins are intended to portray Higgins as a pompous jerk, which he is.  Remember that this is a parody on social norms and expectations that premiered in a time very different from today. "
625,Weekend,"Iâm afraid I saw a very different show than the author of this review.   The songs felt rushed and the dialogue slow which meant the wittiest lines got lost.  Henry was played flat with zero flair and sex appeal.  As Eliza, Ambroseâs poor cockney accent goes in and out as she staggers hunched forward and pigeon toed around the stage drowning in her costumes.   There is no transformation into a regal woman who could possibly pass for a princess.  Elizas costume for the embassy ball is supposed to transform this gutter snipe into a grand lady, but the skin tone gown and a top knot hair style reminiscent of the King and I, only worked to keep her small and uninteresting.<br/>As for the lack of chemistry between Henry and Eliza, might have been played that way so we wouldnât be surprised by her departure at the end.<br/>All in all it was a disappointing experience of a show that I grew up listening to the original â56 cast album and of course the â62 screen version.  I will say the set of the Higgins Home was beautiful, although during the  âjust you waitâ number, I felt I needed a dramamine.  "
626,Weekend,I hope this was filmed for PBS. 
627,Weekend,"This week I saw a preview performance. Lauren Ambrose has a nice voice and is a fine young actress. However, she's not my idea of Eliza Dolittle.<br/><br/>The production was fine generally, and the score remains a great American Songbook Broadway score. But the stage with a serious redhead Eliza (with a redhead's translucent skin) never looked quite right. I have nothing against redheads generally, but this Eliza also comes across as colder than she should be. The audience does not get to fall in love with this Eliza. IMO the ""new"" ending blows chunks.<br/><br/>But then I'm a strong believer that a revival of a show should be trying to show the audience what the show was in its good ol' days and even ""woke"" diversity casting (here as in ""Freddie's"" mother or Billy Bigelow in the new Carousel) is a modern 4th wall breaking PC mistake - I think.<br/><br/>Still, it was nice to hear the score, words and music, live.<br/><br/>PS: Norbert Leo Butz gets to show off as Alfred Dolittle, and was a lot of fun to watch. "
628,Weekend,I enjoyed the review much more than the show.<br/>At the end of the first act I wondered why there was no curtain call. Then I realized that there was more to come and consulted the Playbill to make sure there was no third act. This production focused more on re-interpreting the storyline than creating the lively production quality of LTC's South Pacific and The King and I. 
629,Weekend,Bravo to all involved.  Loved it.  Loved it.  Loved it.<br/><br/>Before the intermission I was looking at my calendar to see when i could get tickets again.  I liked the subtle shift and the ending open to interpretation.  I thought Ambrose was great and the shift in casting to an older Eliza and younger Higgins was brilliant.<br/><br/>You will enjoy it.  Politics change... good music doesn't.<br/><br/>g
630,Weekend,"Jesse Green writes, ""But as Elizaâs father, Alfred, faces marriage . . . we watch as the shabby tavern that helped maintain his status among the 'undeserving poor' flips around to become the shabby church that will deliver him into the worse fate of middle class morality.""<br/><br/>Both Shaw and Lerner have Doolittle say that his wedding will be at St. George's. I'm not a Londoner, but my impression is that St. George's is not shabby"
631,Weekend,"Well, lucky me. Before this very positive review was published, I purchased perhaps the last ticket for the Saturday matinee in May when I will be in Manhattan for my annual visit from Boston. Of the many magnificent musicals from the fifties and sixties the entire score of My Fair Lady is hummable and singable by all. I am thrilled that I have this treat to look forward too. Last year I had the good fortune of seeing Oslo in the same theater and can't wait to see the creative staging I have been reading about."
632,Weekend,"Lauren Ambrose is absolutely extraordinary.  The strength and vulnerability she brings to Eliza is nothing less than breathtaking.  Harry Hadden-Paton is remarkably strong.  Of course, Butz delivers.  As does Danica as Freddy.  Sher uncovers new layers in this ""Lady"" that touch the heart.  ""How lucky we are to be alive right now in New York!"""
633,Weekend,"I'm not at all sure that the producers and directors of revivals should be ""improving"" their source material by adding new dialogue and bits of business- even when those contributions are coming by way of G.B. Shaw.  It's one thing to use actors, lighting and set design to emphasize a specific aspect of a play that hadn't been so noted in previous productions.  It's quite another thing to reshape the play itself by adding text that wasn't there to begin with.  The same thing appears to have happened in the new production of ""Carousel,"" as was alluded to in last week's review.  Too bad the authors of these shows aren't still around to offer their opinions, but from my point of view it seems more like tampering than the exercise of artistic license.   "
634,Weekend,Not sure what show you saw. That's too bad. I thought she was fantastic. And I see almost every show on Bway and tend to be jaded and cynical. Loved this production.
635,Weekend,I meant previous versions of MY FAIR LADY.  Not this one.
636,Weekend,"Female self-actualization has always been a part of Shaw's works.  He spent a great deal of time mingling with the forward-thinking girls of his day.  He also wrote some thoroughly bad and abusive women as well, so don't lionize him.  These facts have nothing to do with whether the show is worth watching.  Reviews should, first, foremost, and always, tell whether a show is worth watching.  Instead they demonstrate the political sensibilities of the author of the review.  We care nothing about reviewers.  We care about the show.  ""This is a good review"" is different from ""This review confirms my pre-existing cultural biases."""
637,Weekend,"Saw MFL and Carousel both in previews and could not agree more. Both shows show their age in terms of their female characters, yet not only did Carousel deal with this more effectively and thematically, but it was far more entertaining and lovely. That can-can thing in MFL just came out of left field. And the ending was some kind of socialist realism. "
638,Weekend,"And to take Jim from Boston's comment one step further, are we now forbidden from producing, consuming and/or enjoying contemporary plays, musicals or movies where say, a damsel in distress or a knight in shining armor are portrayed as protagonists?  Are we no longer permitted to like such characters, or root for them, or wish them a happily ever after ending?<br/><br/>I certainly hope the #MeToo movement (which I whole-heartedly support) hasn't signed the death knell on such characters or scenarios because I, for one, did not sign up for that."
639,Weekend,"Cindy wrote:  ""nor did I ever feel Freddy stood a chance with Eliza.""<br/><br/>The name Shaw gave him says a lot about Shaw's intention.  Us guys named Freddie or Freddy never really got taken seriously with that name until we prove otherwise, though actor Freddie Highmore seems to be changing that.  I've got to assume (really) that's part of the reason August Wilson ditched his real name ""Freddie"" before he sent out his first play.  (And might it be why the My Fair Lady composer stuck to ""Frederick"" for all billing credit purposes, and was normally Fritz when the name was shortened.)"
640,Weekend,"But SJC, their trying to cover differing points of view on the exact same subject has been one of the great things about the Times (as opposed to the NY Post and even - though also beloved to me - the Daily News.)  I've never understood when we complain about one Times article bring inconsistent with another journalist's or Op-Ed writer's article.  I think it's only the official Editorials that are the Times' position.  Even their theatre critics have openly  differed in their print or cyber pages.  <br/><br/>As an example, take a look at Ben Brantley and Jesse Green's lively chat with Jennifer Schuessler while they all watched and live-blogged the Tony awards show together.  Up to three different viewpoints at times!<br/><a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/06/11/theater/tony-awards-chat.html"" title=""https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/06/11/theater/tony-awards-chat.html"" target=""_blank"">https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/06/11/theater/tony-awards-chat....</a>"
641,Weekend,"St. George's would be St. George's, Hanover Square...a posh church which has seen a lot of very fancy people marry there. (Take a look online). By choosing that for Doolittle's marriage, Shaw is underlining Doolittle's money-fuelled social rise. "
642,Weekend,"I had looked it up online. In fact, I read a good deal about St. George's. Since I'm not a Londoner, I hedged a bit in my post just in case the impression I had gotten was wrong. I was perhaps being excessively cautious.<br/><br/>And, yes, that's what I was saying â that it's a posh church where upper-class people get married. I figured it would be understood that my point was that Shaw was using that line of Doolitle's to underline his new status.<br/><br/>So while Mr. Green tells us how Shavian this production is, he inadvertently puts in a detail showing us a way in which it misses Shaw's point. Indeed, that's not the only point of Shaw's that the production seems to miss, if I'm to trust Green's review.<br/><br/>Now I'm not sure that a production of My Fair Lady should worry too much about Shaw's points on every matter., but Green brought it up so . . "
643,Weekend,"Although I agree with your excellent taste in names, I respectfully disagree with you on your review! And I usually find things to like in most performances! "
644,Editorial,"I thought women already had equal rights.  They are certainly doing very well in our society as compared to years ago.  They run companies, they are in every single profession including doctors and lawyers and they hold political office.  Today we have more women attending college than  men.<br/><br/>This is really about abortion and liberals see they have been losing ground in this area.  President Trump has been defending those on the right who are pro life which never occurred before.  He has appointed pro life members to his cabinet and has many in his administration who are strongly for the movement.  Laws have been passed to restrict abortion and they see abortion rights slipping away from them.  Many Planned Parenthood facilities have closed and pregnancy centers are popping up throughout the country.  <br/><br/>As a woman, I am for equal rights for all and not just one sex.  Women have made tremendous gains and nothing has held them back except the women themselves.  They can do anything they want and can achieve success in any area they want.

650,OpEd,I guarantee Trump voters are happy with their tax cut. He said they got a tax cut and they believe him. You may ask why? Because Trump voters are unable to understand numbers. They believe what they are told. 
651,Metro,As someone who employs a Nanny - my wife and I have found this whole episode incredibly harrowing and tragic. <br/><br/>We fully support the idea of legislation aimed at making sure these kind of awful situations don't ever happen again. 
652,Metro,I donât understand.  People donât want to spend decent money to hire someone vetted by an agency and then blame others because their caregivers werenât properly vetted?  I really feel for this family but isnât the blame for lack of vetting somewhat misplaced?  
653,Washington,"One of the first things that popped into my mind after the Steele dossier was reported was that creepy interview where Mr. Giuliani kept repeating ""you'll see...""  I'm betting that it will eventually be disclosed that he was as much a part of the treason as Mr. Trump, and makes me wonder if somehow he is now shielded by being named to Mr. Trump's legal team.<br/><br/>Perhaps now that he is back in the limelight, Mr. Giuliani can explain how the Zarrab case unfolded, and the (wink) coincidental firing of U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara (who brought the charges against Mr. Zarrab for circumventing sanctions on Iran) by Mr. Trump. "
654,Washington,"I'm sure Giuliani's ex-wives are watching this with great interest.  They have stories to tell that could rival anything that women have revealed about Trump.  And quite possibly these stories intersect with Michael Cohen.  You go, Rudy.  Just be sure you aren't opening yourself up to scrutiny of your very interesting life.  "
655,Washington,Beneath Tom's dignity.
656,Business,Just wait until the government is starved to the size that it can be drown in a bathtub. Huge corporations like Wells Fargo will be free to fleece the public like nobody's business. The stock market will soar!
657,Sports,"What a shame the Post Office settled for only $5 million.  If they had won the case and received $100 million, we wouldn't see an increase in the cost of stamps for at least another year!"
658,Sports,"Cycling was, and still is, dirty. Lance was the best of the worst.  These riders are pros, trying to make a living in an extremely dangerous sport. Even so called amateurs use PEDs now.  Anyone who thinks otherwise is naive.  Lance is not the man monster his critics say he is, but instead is a scapegoat."
659,Sports,He cheated; the other guy cheated; and they both still have millions more than the rest of us.
660,Sports,"I remember cycling in Italy in 1999 when Lance was winning his first tour. I stopped in a small town that only had French newspapers. The dossier compiled by Le Monde implied very strongly that Lance was cheating. In other words no one in Europe, especially France, had many illusions about Lance--already in 1999! The whole farce then continued for another 13 years..."
661,Sports,A couple of ways to get doping out of the Tour de France would be to get big big money out of it and make it less hard. Expecting human beings to be mountain goats is unreasonable. 
662,Sports,"$5M when he reportedly made $100M+ off his cheating? Better than nothing, but not enough."
663,Sports,A world class JERK.  Period.
664,Sports,"I thought fraud was a criminal offense  with s possability of jail time. Just like Wells Fargo Armstrong gets to negotiate a fine and walks away. Good thing he didn't steal a apple, that would have been a real crime."
665,Sports,Nice to see that lying and cheating still has consequences in some realms of life.
666,Sports,"As many other serious although not professional bike riders Armstrong was my idol for many years until he confessed to doping. He is not the only one and there will continue to be riders using synthetic EPO as well as many other drugs. Although watchdog agencies try as best they can to monitor doping it still continues. <br/><br/>Professional cycling is a very tough and demanding sport but no sport should allow doping, period. The very worst part of this story is that Armstrong was a bully and sought to defame others. In a sense that is only a part by a very sad and unfortunate part of it.<br/><br/>While I never liked Floyd Landis for what I believed was a very petty and vindictive attack on Armstrong, he did what he did essentially for the good of the sport. "
667,Sports,"What counts as ""doping"" has always been an arbitrary line. Every top-flight athlete is tweaking her or his body chemically and technically, most often by taking advantage of immense public or private subsidies or sponsorships. Nobody is a found object. Moreover, as the Armstrong case reminds us in spades, athletes judged ""clean"" at one point in their career can be reclassified as ""dirty"" at another through retesting or other evidence, and then revisionist history kicks in with a vengeance. Both reporters and spectators seem to ignore one of the most important implications of this case: how many other putatively clean and honorable athletes got away with it simply because the spotlight wasn't turned on them? Armstrong was the most conspicuous target ever, and look how long it took the mighty guardians of purity to catch him! I think skepticism is the only adult emotion when it comes to professional sports. It is spectacle, and far too many interests press on the scales to make concepts like ""clean"" or ""pure"" be reasonable metrics in modern sports."
668,Sports,"The USPS made 100s of millions on their European package shipping business as a result of their $33 million they spent on sponsoring Armstrongâs team.  Thatâs right, the USPS Cycling Team made the USPS and by extension the U.S. taxpayers 100s of millions.  Are people aware that the USPS runs for profit package shipping in Europe to the benefit of the U.S. taxpayer?  The USPS - Armstrong deal made the U.S. taxpayers millions."
669,Sports,"They do legalize and manage doping. It's legal in no part and managed as we see here, by testing, analysis, and prosecution."
670,Well,"I bought a bag of mxed greens for my wife at my local Stop &amp; Shop this weekend.  I knew the bag contained romaine, but I thought ""if they're selling this stuff, and even whole heads of romaine, despite the warning, it must all be OK.""  When I got home, my wife joked that I was trying to kill her off.  Looks like I was foolish to buy it, and Stop &amp; Shop was negligent in selling it."
671,Well,"Why is it that the NY Times (and most media outlets) make a big deal out of incidents such as this when it involves salad greens, while hundreds, perhaps thousands of Americans DIE each year mostly from tainted chicken and to a lesser extent other meats?<br/><br/>Is it because tainted veggies are basically rare and therefore a news item, while deadly meat is an every day occurrence?<br/><br/>Meat, poultry, eggs and seafood account for well over 2/3 of food borne illnesses. <br/><br/><a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/foodborneburden/attribution-image.html"" title=""https://www.cdc.gov/foodborneburden/attribution-image.html"" target=""_blank"">https://www.cdc.gov/foodborneburden/attribution-image.html</a><br/><br/>There is an element of sensationalism, intentional provoking of anxiety, to this kind of coverage, that really irks me in a news organization like the NY Times. The public needs to know if there is a dangerous product, by all means. But the one sided coverage actually does more damage because it hides the bigger danger."
672,Well,Can I put the old Romaine leaves in my compost pile? ...and then after it has composted for a couple months spread the compost in my herb garden?  
673,Well,"This article is a reminder that we need to have strong protections in place to protect against food borne illnesses. The Republicans want to get rid of laws that protect clean air, water and food. "
674,Well,"WWD,<br/>This is not about food in restaurants.  It is the salad that you eat at home (or work, as I am doing right now)<br/>And what about people who don't have the money, time or access to 1-3 above.<br/>Seems to me that your suggestions are on the  ""let them eat cake"" continuum too."
675,Well,You didn't read the article. The advisory is extended to whole head and leaf lettuce.
676,Well,Our own salads are plotting against us. This is why Americans need more guns. 
677,Well,"""All produce is a hazard.""<br/><br/>Exactly. That is why I survive exclusively on a diet of Drake's Cakes and Slim Jims."
678,Washington,"There are dozens of comments below wondering why McCabe is in legal jeopardy for lying, and Trump isn't.  <br/><br/>Their feelings of injustice are reinforced by stories carried daily by NYT and other MSM highlighting Trump's lies. Fair enough.<br/><br/>But it is not balanced journalism to fail to equally highlight Obama's lies. It's so well-known it's almost trivial to recall his famous ""If you like your doctor..."" lie.  There's also his ""I found out about Hillary's server when I read about it in the newspaper..."" lie.  Never mind that several his emails to her were done under an alias.  Has ANYONE in the media EVER asked him why he did that?  Not that I recall. And there's his ""ISIS is caused by climate change"" lie, and dozens of others.<br/><br/>At the same time, Trump's ""Obama wiretapped me in Trump Tower..."" comment that drew all kinds of ridicule a year ago from NYT is starting to look more likely true in the fullness of time.  Comey, Brennan, and Clapper all denied anything like that could have happened.  Their denials covered Trumps campaign.  And NYT dutifully headlined their denials.  That was before the public was informed about the FISA warrants of Carter Page.<br/><br/>I'd prefer it be illegal for politicians to lie, but it's not.  If it were, they'd be tied up in court all the time.<br/><br/>Back to McCabe- his lies were to his colleagues and superiors in the FBI - some under oath.  Lying to them is against the law.   He should be prosecuted the same way Michael Flynn was."
679,Washington,"No, what your comment tells me is that progressives will shoot any messenger that threatens the FBI good/Trump bad/poor hapless Hillary story to the point of a non-falsifiable religious cult."
680,Dining,"My God, but this was beautifully written! Thank you."
681,Dining,"This sounds great.  Almost 25 years ago I often drove from Seattle over to Bellevue to a non-descript strip mall that had a small Chinese restaurant serving the most fantastic spicy beef noodles  (soup).  East 7th is much closer (though contending with Manhattan crowds will be much worse, alas)."
682,Foreign,"He meant well, but thats not enough for some."
683,Foreign,"Did he know that they were going to be killed?  Did he send them there for that purpose? Or did he just say there were uneducable, which perhaps was  his honest and unbiased, although wrong by our understanding, opinion. <br/><br/>You have to be careful here not to condemn everyone who lived in Germany and Austria with collusion to Nazi atrocities, for if you do, apart from being unfair,  you create a backlash, which lessens the historical significance of the real criminals."
684,Foreign,Asperger's entanglement in the euthanasia program is not news. Steve Silberman talked about it in his interview with Terry Gross in 2015. I wonder what new details the author uncovered.
685,Science,"It is correct to say that the Bajau have ""enlarged"" spleens or just larger ones?  Enlarged would mean that they started out smaller and their size was increased by an external something -- not a mutation that could be passed on.  I think what is meant is that these people are born with larger spleens."
686,Science,I hope scientists the world over do lots of these types of studies (respectfully) with isolated and indigenous populations. Our human biodiversity is fascinating! 
687,Science,"Please.  Nobody ""gains"" a mutation.  The lifestyle selects out those who don't have it, or can't develop the physical requirements some other way.  When you look at a group of people with some physical feature that sets them apart, remember that they are the survivors and everybody else in their lineage died without offspring.<br/><br/>Evolution is the outcome of a lot of death."
688,Science,"I'd take a bit of fresh, cold water applied externally to any phramaceutical. "
689,Science,"Unfortunately commercial fishing, piracy, and conflict in recent decades has resulted in the Bajau abandoning much of their ancestral domain at sea and they have been moving towards being a more land based tribe. In addition, western missionaries have also had a negative effect on their traditions and culture in recent years. Sadly the Bajau and their way of life is slowly disappearing."
690,Dining,"Commodities claiming to be ""natural"" must necessarily answer to the two questions as to what's 'natural' means:<br/><br/>1) Does nature mean ""without human intervention?"" In this case, no, there is no such thing as 'natural' wine; it's a human artifact tutti quanti. <br/><br/>2) In a historical  sense, was there ever a time when wines were less a byproduct of human culture? Again, no. Modern technology  gives<br/>us more evolved and efficient methods because technology itself is cumulative. Everyone has always used all the available technology.<br/><br/>So what we're left with is oenological cherry-picking in reverse-- the humpty-dumpy grower declares that 'organic' is what I choose to call it at the time that I say it; that clueless band of sommelieros follow footstep. <br/><br/>No sulfur? No problem! Just let the wild yeast attack the s.cerevisiae, halt fermentation, and cause funky off-odors that can then be marketed as 'earthy'. <br/><br/>But what you won't obtain are the flavors that have been associated with 'varietal character for the last 1200 years or so. Rather, the same random fruit-funk that's present in all mismanaged varietals because achieving  varietal character means letting those tame, lab-grown yeats do their job.<br/><br/>Lastly, the Organic movement appears to be a hysterical over-reaction to serious industrial questions that indeed beg for consumer advocacy. Yet these are the ayatollahs overthrowing The Shah, The bolshies against The Czar. As such, it's a farce."
691,Dining,I admire you Eric. You once said your biggest challenge re your job is not getting plastered (I cleaned up what you said).<br/><br/>Unfortunately I have not mastered that.<br/><br/>Just give me a bottle of good inexpensive cheap wine like just about any red wine from Chile and I am happy.
692,Dining,"So nice to hear that the fine people from 360 have landed on their feet.  What a time it was.<br/><br/>I've yet to taste a natural wine I like, but my mind is still open.  So many so-called natural wines have tasted all-too-funky, as if the terroir were not a concept, but a scoop of soil added to the mix."
693,Dining,"Eric, you neglected to include the first pioneers in TriBeCa of curating ânaturalâ and organic wine - Chambers Street Wines. "
694,Dining,I am in complete agreement with Jorgeâs assessment regarding food/wine hangovers. Iâve been drinking low alcohol and low sulphur content natural wines for awhile now. I enjoy feeling better the next morning. Bravo!!
695,Dining,"I think you've inadvertently addressed Eric's uncle.<br/><br/>Otherwise, I'm not sure why a winemaker can't make wines the way he or she wants to and not be called names or considered relic.  There are a lot of very high-end furniture makers still working largely by hand, with machine intervention at only the very low level stages of preparing the wood.  I see nothing different with this particular approach to wine.  I think it's refreshing, frankly, if for nothing more than a lower level of alcohol a lot of these wines have which to my palate makes them more food-friendly."
696,Express,"It is 100% on the police to have handled this situation better than they did. The barista who made the call could have made it for a number of reasons: it's entirely possible that a customer demanded the action. But even if the barista WAS making a decision derived from racial bias, it was on the police to have handled the situation better. Starbucks did not make the decision to arrest those men. The police did and they should be held accountable."
697,Express,"The more I ponder this, this angrier I get. Black people are incarcerated at a ten times the rate of white people. Unarmed black people are routinely shot and killed by police who are only rarely held accountable for their unjustified and unjust homicides. But two provocateurs get tossed out of a Starbucks and we go apoplectic over man's inhumanity to man? That's enough to make me ashamed to be white."
698,Express,"Police exists to make society uneventful, that is what I believe must be their duty. But I know they sometimes do the opposite to promote their agendas or their employer's. (In the case of my country they arrest people who are against the government for minor infractions like trespassing.) But in this case I cannot understand what the police's motivation is. Did they just want to show they were not lazy by making an event? Or their racism or emotion rising from race is just so strong that they are just carried away."
699,Express,"Starbuck's environment is to blame. Whenever I went into a Starbucks on my own it was to use the rest room or to get warm during the winter and perhaps sit down - of course I would order a beverage. But here is the rub about Starbucks: it forster's an environment that encourages people to sit all day nursing an empty cup of coffee and there is rarely an available seat because of it. Most folks do meet others for business such as the men in this story and I never seen folks challenged to buy something etc. Their story is plausible and the police seemed just concerned with their removal. Starbuck encourages it's patrons to lounge about so why not these 2 men - singling them out? Also these two men, why didn't one of them by a beverage - are they moochers? I think all 3 parties were at fault.  "
700,Express,"I am a white middle aged female runner in NYC.  When I go for long runs, I often stop at a Starbucks store when I need to use the restroom -- alone or with fellow runners -- and ask if I can use it. I have never been turned down; I have never been asked if I plan to purchase anything; store employees have never called the police and I have never been arrested. You think maybe my race, gender and age have anything to do with that? "
701,Express,"I recommend that everybody's take the Harvard implicit association test <a href=""https://implicit.harvard.edu/implicit/"" title=""https://implicit.harvard.edu/implicit/"" target=""_blank"">https://implicit.harvard.edu/implicit/</a> and read the book blindspot. <a href=""http://blindspot.fas.harvard.edu/Book"" title=""http://blindspot.fas.harvard.edu/Book"" target=""_blank"">http://blindspot.fas.harvard.edu/Book</a>. You might be surprised by the results."
702,Express,"On the one hand the two men should have ordered something while they waited.   Starbucks, Panero Bread and others are quite generous with their premises and ordering something is just a common courtesy. On the other hand it was stupid and reckless to call the police.  Sadly, it is hard to escape the conclusion that if two white men had sat down and waited there would have been no incident.   However, for me this is a case of two wrongs in that no one seemed to have done anything that would have defused the situation and now we have a national controversy and a holy war inspired by the lack of a cup of coffee,  "
703,Express,"Female manager probably felt threatened or it was, in fact, Starbucks policy--why she wasn't fired but moved.  <br/><br/>But that aside, what are restaurant owners to do when people off the street want to use the facilities for free and hang out buying nothing, taking a paying table off the floor?  <br/><br/>In Europe, they are asked once, sometimes politely, and then the police are called--especially in Paris."
704,Express,"Howard Schulz, who founded Starbucks, postures as a liberal, hip guy. Not true! Starbucks is a nasty outfit. Its marketing has convinced working class folk, esepcially women, to load up on 500 - 600 calorie drinks thus contributing to the obesity epidemic. Besides,  just think: a $5.00 sweet drink (w/whipped cream) and a doughnut all for $7 for people who are earning $10 per hr. Huh!! Furthermore, Starbuck serves up lousy coffee. They buy cheap beans and then burn them. The regular coffees taste like tar. Starbucks is just another nasty chain store pretending to be cool."
705,Express,Disgruntled employee who hates working there decides to get the store in trouble by making an unwarranted call.  5 minutes is the standard wait time. Everyone in the biz knows that.
706,Express,"I don't believe their ""two minutes"" claim, and I don't believe they didn't know why they were being handcuffed. Trespassing is against the law. If you refuse to leave someone else's property, you ARE trespassing, and trespassing IS against the law. Starbucks could have pressed charges, but declined to. "
707,Express,Kudos and thanks to these two young men. I feel their message is so much stronger because they didn't resist the officers. What happened to them is despicable. They provided the best example of how to deal with an unjust situation. May we all learn from their example!
708,Express,"1) What was the crime?<br/>2) You can arrest without it?<br/>3) When Police arrived, why didn't Manager just tell them<br/>     to leave.(still wrong, but better)<br/>4) On what basis did Police arrest?<br/>5) Starbucks Training tip of iceberg........"
709,Express,"Iâm white, live in Philly and once sat in a Starbucks (not that one but close by) with another white person and talked for an hour without ordering a drink or food. No one seemed to care. Certainly no one called the police. "
710,Express,"I've had many meetings at Starbucks where I didn't order anything. I can't remember whether others meeting with me ordered, but it's Starbucks policy to encourage meetings. There aren't any rules about ordering that I know of. In fact, I'm surprised that a Starbucks employee approached the men, as the baristas are completely occupied behind the counter in any Starbucks I've visited. This seems like unusual attention to me."
711,Express,Why couldn't they just order something? 
712,Express,"Two things need to stop happening: 1. People being judged by the color of their skin. 2. People believing you're going to be killed by the police because of the color of their skin, and that it's common. Here's the math:<br/><br/>2,197,140 black arrests divided by 223 fatal police shootings = 1 police killing per 9,850 arrests for blacks<br/><br/>5,753,212 white and Hispanic arrests divided by 636 fatal police shootings = 1 killing per 9,050 arrests for whites and Hispanics<br/><br/>I say this because the two black individuals said they were scared they may be killed. From a USA Today story: Robinson said he thought about his loved ones and how the afternoon had taken such a turn as he was taken to jail. Nelson wondered if heâd make it home alive. âAnytime Iâm encountered by cops, I can honestly say itâs a thought that runs through my mind,â Nelson said. âYou never know whatâs going to happen.â<br/><br/>Shooting Source: <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/national/police-shootings-2017/"" title=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/national/police-shootings-2017/"" target=""_blank"">https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/national/police-shootings-2017/</a><br/>FBI Data arrests:<br/><a href=""https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2015/crime-in-the-u.s.-2015/tables/table-43"" title=""https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2015/crime-in-the-u.s.-2015/tables/table-43"" target=""_blank"">https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2015/crime-in-the-u.s.-2015/tables/...</a>"
713,Express,"I shop for books at Goodwill. The store has recently begun locking the restrooms because local drunks used the facilities to relieve themselves.  Afterwards, they would very aggressively pester shoppers for ""bus fare"".   None of these drunks were black or brown, so ""racial profiling"" may be an extreme interpretation in this case.  On the other hand, improved communication would have helped, especially before calling the police.  "
714,Express,I am imagining how terrified I would feel if two police handcuffed me and led me away for really doing nothing.  Just sitting in a coffee shop.  Absolutely terrifying.  In that moment you are completely vulnerable and helpless.  Can you rely on the people nearby to speak up on your behalf?  Probably not.  People think that as soon as police put cuffs on you you MUST be tainted with guilt somehow.   Didn't ANYONE speak on behalf of these two men in the moment?  Appalling.
715,Express,I thought restaurants could control their premises and restrict their use to paying customers. When did Starbucks become a public space?
716,Express,The Police Officers should be fired. They behaved so much like Boston Cops the resemblance is uncanny.  I hope the young men file law suits against everyone concerned. 
717,Express,"It happened in two minutes? Wow. I had the impression that they had been there a while. Two minutes to tell them to leave and call the police is racism, pure and simple. "
718,Express,"""The manager approached, asked them if they wanted to order drinks. They declined.""<br/><br/>There's a word for people like this, whether they be black, white, or Asian: schnorrer. That is Yiddish for sponger or mooch. I don't go into Starbucks or coffee shops unless I am going to order something. In New York City, there's a big problem with old people taking over tables in various McDonald's for hours at a time, playing cards with their cronies but not buying anything. Hit the bricks, freeloaders! I don't care what color your skin is: if you want to sit at a table, pony up."
719,Express,"A complete and total lack of common sense.  First, by the Starbucks employee.  But, ESPECIALLY by the Police.  No matter how they try to spin it, those Cops were acting as private security, for a bubblehead.  Period.<br/>  DO BETTER.  Please."
720,Express,"None of this makes sense, unless the two men said something aggressive to the manager upon being denied use of the bathroom. Replay the reported events in your mind. Now, imagine they said something nasty when denied use. Now, everything else makes sense. granted, my scenario is hypothetical, because we don't know, but my version (in which the two men say something aggressive) makes complete sense. <br/><br/>If these two men cursed the manager, everything else makes complete sense, as it went down. <br/><br/>Nobody, as far as I know, has asked one single question about the verbal exchange between them and the manager. Interviewers seem to be avoiding the topic. "
721,Express,"While it's appalling that the police were called and these men arrested for nothing, they should have known that you can just sit at a table ANYWHERE and use the restroom but not order anything...if they were Caucasians, the staff would have ask ed them to leave (but sans calling the cops)."
722,Express,"It's great that Starbucks has apologized and is going to do a training, but there are other problems with Starbucks. My suggestion is to never patronize Starbucks unless you happen to live in Seattle --- and always always always support locally-owned establishments. "
723,Express,"How many white people have gone into a Starbucks for hours and sat working on their laptops, and used the restroom, gotten a water cup, and only MAYBE spent a couple bucks? How many white people have gone into bookstores, sat in their chairs, looked at their books and magazines, used their restrooms, and never purchased one thing. And how many of those white people would consider what they did trespassing or criminal in any way?<br/><br/>And this story is not just about Starbucks. The Philadelphia Police Department had a true opportunity here to be part of the solution. Instead they went along with the same old routine. There needs to be outrage and a change in the police response to such an incident. The police are not personal security officers for the ignorant, prejudice or racist. They have a responsibility to use their heads and sound judgment and know when a situation does NOT warrant handcuffs. <br/><br/>For the record, I am white, and I know this all needs to stop. More people and institutions need to be part of the solution, and the first step is to recognize there's a problem. Wake up to the problem, so we can all come together for a solution where EVERYONE can enjoy a visit to Starbucks, or the bookstore, or any place. "
724,Express,"âAnytime Iâm encountered by cops, I can honestly say itâs a thought that runs through my mind,â he said. âYou never know whatâs going to happen.â<br/><br/>So you defy them and increase the risk of a violent confrontation? These guys made a bad situation worse. Non-story. "
725,Express,Who ever said anyone has that right? Is a private business responsible for creating public spaces? No. That has never been the deal â for any race. A shop is not a municipal park or library. 
726,Express,"JaneR,<br/><br/>TWO MINUTES."
727,Express,"Can't be sure, the show is over, and the topic of race was avoided. I am wishing that police treat folks in their areas as Sheriff Taylor did for the Mayberrians. Is there a better example to use for this point?"
728,Express,"Ok dirty white guy, you can take a bath and clean up and not be judged by your appearance.<br/>These guys were neatly dressed black guys; they can't do anything to stop being black, and (pre)judged for it, even for a day.<br/>So I suggest you are showing your white privilege, and yes your prejudice, to try to draw a parallel between these circumstance. Walk a mile in these black guys shoes..."
729,Express,"If you were younger or blonder, I bet they would let you use the restroom. Age bias is real sis."
730,Express,"Why can't these guys use their words? Why do we have to assume that they were going to buy something when they could have easily said they were going to??<br/><br/>Yes, this situation was handled poorly, but on BOTH SIDES."
731,Express,"She wasn't fired - she and Starbucks came to a 'mutual agreement' that she not work there anymore.<br/><br/>Why do you assume anyone wants to 'do [something] to her'??<br/><br/>It would be helpful to see if this is a part of a larger pattern. On whom does this manager or this Starbucks call for emergency assistance from the police in such a casual manner. If you listen to the 911 call, the manager seems fairly nonchalant.  <br/><br/>Calling 911 seems like it should be saved for emergencies.<br/><br/><a href=""http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5627691/Starbucks-manager-called-cops-black-men-faces-new-race-claims.html"" title=""http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5627691/Starbucks-manager-called-cops-black-men-faces-new-race-claims.html"" target=""_blank"">http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5627691/Starbucks-manager-called...</a>"
732,Express,"Sure they can. If they want to bar non-paying customers they can absolutely do that. If they want to bar only non-paying customers who are blacks, well, then that's a problem, and that seems to be what happened here."
733,Express,"The consequence is that you could lose your life, even if the order by the police officer was unlawful. This is the reality of black men."
734,Express,They were there for two minutes and the friend arrived as they were being arrested.  The point is no white person would ever have been asked to leave or arrested. B
735,Express,"I am a 71year old white woman. I have used many Starbucks bathrooms over the years. Sometimes I walked in, used the bathroom and left. Sometimes, I came out of the bathroom, waited for a friend and ordered after my friend arrived. I have never been questioned, stopped, or given a dirty look. I don't feel quilty about using a Starbucks toilet without buying anything. It's a public place. If you had an older woman's bladder, you'd understand. But why shouldn't a young black man be treated with the same respect accorded an older white woman."
736,Express,"Yes, the employee should be fired. Living in the U.S. means you should know some basic rules, both legal and human, about racial equality. If the manager told the employee to ask the 2 men to leave, the employee should have refused to do so and reported the manager. "
737,Express,"Finally!!  Someone published how long these men were in the store before the staff decided to call law enforcement. Two minutes?  It only took a week for that information to become available.  And you are right, that really says it all about what happened.  I have worked in the service industry and 2 minutes is not loitering.  In that situation it would have been really simple for the staff to simply check the clock and if these guys were still taking up space say 20 minutes later, ask them to wait outside.  Seats are for paying customers after all.  A little patience and none of this would have happened."
738,Express,Philadelphia a liberal town though.
739,Express,"Take another look at the video -- the police were not both white. The problem is not at all unrelated to racial bias, it happened because of racial bias on the part of the store employee who decided the police needed to step in and handle a ""situation"" that didn't exist. Think about it a moment. Why was their explanation rejected? Would your explanation be rejected in a similar situation? I know mine would not, no matter how I was dressed, because I'm a middle aged white woman."
740,Express,I think Starbucks has responded.  The two employees who were responsible no longer work for Starbucks.  
741,Express,"I love Pogo, sir, but in this case, you are not right. Implicit bias training can indeed make people more aware of the thought processes that go into the way we evaluate others ""at first sight"". It's not a quick fix, and it can't immediately eliminate bias. It's not designed for that. Bias can only be eliminated after it's been recognized. Implicit bias training helps with recognizing those biases and being aware of them. Wherever that store manager has gone to, I hope she gets some of this type of training. She needs it!"
742,Express,And the Philadelphia police are nothing compared to the liberties taken by ICE.
743,Express,"That's rude.  My five dollar latte is buying your free soap, towels and cleaning time.  Not to mention the promise I will wait in line for you to come out.  Buy the kids a hot chocolate.  Exercise some respect.  If I leave my Starbucks stops, it will be because by 'business' is not their priority.  And your lack of respect is."
744,Express,Interesting that no one seems to look at the fact that one of these two guys bullied at least one other customer and behaved disrespectful and some might even say racist. The Video of that is on YouTube just look for it. And no it's no racism if someone who doesn't behave is asked to leave a private store and if that person doesn't leave the police has to do their job.<br/><br/> If you have a meeting which is apparently that important just follow the policy of the company and get something to drink or eat instead of bullying other ppl. and then playing the victim and refusing to take responsibility for your own actions
745,Express,"Its interesting that you label, scapegoat, paint with a broad brush with the term ""snowflakeism"" just like you blame this on the behavior of the 2 men ... much more complex than that psychologically and sociologically ... its clear what your automatic thinking is ..."
746,Express,"Every time I read about the experience these two men had, I find tears in my eyes. They literally did *nothing* wrong, except be the wrong color (and, arguably, combination of color and gender). As a middle-aged white woman I can't tell you the number of times I've gone into Starbucks, sat down, fiddled with a laptop, checked my phone messages, and then, a few minutes later, got up and gone to the counter to order. Or the number of times I've arranged to meet someone at Starbucks to complete a Craigslist transaction, and never ordered anything at all. (It's a safe, neutral, businesslike space, perfect for that kind of thing.) As a middle-aged white woman I had zero fear -- then or now -- that doing any of these things without walking up to the counter to order something would lead to any kind of confrontation with, or even approach to me by, a manager. I am so glad that their friend came in when he did, and that that other middle aged white woman (yay us, ha ha) took that video and posted it for the world to see. And I am grateful to Starbucks for treating this with real importance, and shutting down their stores a full day for mandatory implicit bias training. Way to step up and show other corporations how anti-bias work is done, Starbucks."
747,Well,People need to remind these children throughout their life through adulthood need to learn about personal space and what's right and wrong to do and to always ask for consent no matter what.
748,Well,"Back in the 50's there was little harrasment of our young ladies, we were taught to treat them with respect, and did!  I suspect that the ""Hippy"" revolution and the subsequent and continuing push for Female Equality, has taken womanhood off of any pedestal and, of their own volition, put them in the same arena with men, where aggressive competitiveness is an imperative, for which most females are ill prepared, as of yet, to deal with effectively!"
749,Arts&Leisure,Congratulations on winning the award and getting the film done.  What an achievement!<br/><br/>Will you release it to wider audiences?
750,Arts&Leisure,"I'm an American living in South Africa and I hope this film is shown here. There is a lot of ""Nollywood"" on TV here so there should be an audience. I really look forward to seeing this and I'm glad there was a story about the film. The more publicity, the better!"
751,Arts&Leisure,I've had the experience of having an idea and then actually having the money dropped on my head. Every single undefined detail becomes crucial and sleep become troubled to the same extent.<br/>And I did my project in a familiar environment.<br/>Best of luck to Mr. Okoro and I'd love to buy something as a souvenir that would support his project.
752,Arts&Leisure,"Congratulations to Mr. Okoro for winning the award, for successfully finishing his first feature film and for transporting Americans to Africa, something rarely done without animals or Tarzan incorporated.  It was through books by authors like Chimamanda Ngozie Adichie, Imbolo Mbue, and Okey Ndibe that I came to better understand modern day Africa which for me, an African American, was necessary to better understand the world of my ancestors and how it is that I differ so greatly from other Americans. Can't wait to see Nigerian Prince."
753,RealEstate,"If it really is what is happening, this is pretty good news. It is a sign that things are working as they should: developers build to cater to the most profitable market (high-end apartments), until there is not enough demand at the crazy levels of rent that we are seeing today. As a result, landlords have to entice renters with lower prices, which should have a ripple effect on the rest of the market (since high-earners renting these luxury places wonât compete with lower-earners for older places of lower quality).<br/><br/>Ideally, this would be the moment where our deciders start encouraging development of more free-market apartments, by easing zoning laws, freeing up land, approving large development projects, and why not by launching its own projects. By showing that everything will be done to keep prices on a downward trajectory, many people will stop using property as piggy banks to be bought at any price, creating a virtuous circle. And who knows, maybe in a couple of years New Yorkers will stop moving further and further from their work, living in smaller and smaller apartments of declining quality."
754,SundayBusiness,"International organizations like IMF and World Bank look at economies on a macro level. Perhaps due to their inability to sound the alarm bells prior to 2008, this time they want to cover their arse to throw everything out there, JUST SO they can tell anyone who care to listen that ""don't say we didn't warn you.""<br/><br/>Yes, I see warnings, but not so much of the reasons that IMF or World Bank has listed.<br/><br/>Trade wars? Blah. For all the rah-rah from Trump, this guy can't stomach any voters revolt (more specifically, the voters who voted for him), those like farmers and workers. Mark my words, he's going to backpedal, big time, just like he did with the tariffs on steel, with so many exemptions to the big exporters to US that it really doesn't matter. (China is really become a minority player in our steel imports in recent years that tariffs would barely a scratch.)<br/><br/>China will feel the hurt, but its market has become so big now that it will survive. Beijing will also throw in all its weight to support normalcy, given its large reserve and certain insularity from external shock with limited trading of RMB.<br/><br/>What is really worrisome, is the fission on a micro-level in so many countries. The top 10-20% globally are all doing very well, but that leaves large majority of world population struggling to survive and remain unproductive. Remember how Hitler got his rise and started WWII? Bad economy and struggling citizenry.<br/><br/>Live, and let live. We are all better served to remember that."
755,SundayBusiness,"I want to add to my post that I just made, printed below:  Example:  I received a job promotion that was supposed to definitely take effect in January 2017.  That is over a year ago.  Believe me, I know it is past due, because every day I recognize that I am:  ""not in position"", like I am supposed to be.  This is a problem, because this position is very ""high-up"".  In fact it is referred to as:  #1.  I think the last #1, has already left the building, and has started his Baby Boomer vacation bucket list to do items.... that are long overdue.  I am Generation X.  I know that things are not ""in order"" because, still today, I am ""out of place"".  I am not formally in position.  It isn't that I lose the #1 position because I am not there, it is more like, things get worse for others, until I am formally in position as the new #1.  "
756,SundayBusiness,No mention of the environment or finite natural resources. I'd have to conclude that economists aren't particularly farsighted either.
757,SundayBusiness,âThe present good times will not last for long...â <br/><br/>Perhaps. What is absolutely certain is that there's never been a year in recorded history when that statement hasn't been made.
758,SundayBusiness,"Economists living up to their fieldâs reputation as the dismal science? Get real. First of all, economics is not a science and is highly subjective. Secondly, if it were science, it would take into account sociopolitical and environmental factors, such as declining natural resources, climate change, and overpoplulation, none of which are even considered or mentioned in this article. Most economists are amazingly ignorant about the connection between the economy and the environment and are just too arrogant and narrow minded to worry about it. It's high time that the study of economics be redefined and expanded to look more realistically at the relationships between society and the environment, and to address how economic growth and the conventional modern definition of a thriving economy is often at odds with a healthy planet and the well being of its human and nonhuman inhabitants."
759,SundayBusiness,"Persistent trade imbalances and the profligate public debt of the United States are the kind of deadly serious problems that set the stage for a retreat from rationally informed actions and reactions toward an almost inevitable viscerally guided confrontation.<br/><br/>Germany wrapped itself in the Euro, protecting themselves from currency exchange rate adjustments.<br/><br/>China is acting so badly on so many vectors that it's mind-numbing to list them, but epic currency manipulation is right at the tops of that list.<br/><br/>Japan has the huge problem of a shrinking and population whose cost of care the rest of the world is simply going to have to get used to paying.<br/><br/>The US is being driven into the ditch by an unholy alliance of pandering politicians and feckless citizens who conspire to keep in office only those who will vote endless entitlements while passing the cost to future generations.<br/><br/>Free and fair trade would solve a lot of this, but nobody is willing to actually go there.<br/><br/>What a great world we live in!"
760,SundayBusiness,The US also could mandate balanced trade. Exporters could be granted $ credits that importers must buy on a regulated exchange before releasing equivalent $ to pay for imports. This once was proposed by Warren Buffett and almost made it through Congress until killed by special interest lobbyists.  Fact!
761,SundayBusiness,"There is no such thing as ""the economy."" It's long been described as though it is a common good, but that assumption is being shattered with transparency.  Whose economy, which economy, who benefits, who does not?  Those issues can't be glossed over as easily by describing something that is so fundamentally political as though it is not. We make a serious intellectual mistake when the discipline of political economy was bifurcated into two disciplines that are largely ignorant about each other.  As one Texas legislator once proudly announced, ""In this game there are winners and losers, and we get to decide who they are."""
762,SundayBusiness,"Why are world leaders so gloomy?  Many of them are intelligent and realize that the majority is often wrong, dooming the future of democracy.  The key example is population growth.  A book, Limits to Growth, was published in 1972, which gave several possible scenarios for the future of life on planet earth if population continued to grow.  China took the book seriously.  In 1979, China introduced a one-child program to limit population growth.  Americans for the most part held the book up for ridicule.  Those who warned that population growth couldn't continue forever were ridiculed as crackpots.  So nothing was done.  World population has doubled since 1972.  One of the consequences is global warming, and that has the attention of scientists.  But amazingly nobody seems to notice the impact that population growth has on global warming.  So now we are beginning to see other consequences.  The UN estimates that 800 million people worldwide suffer from chronic malnutrition.  Shortages are causing tremendous suffering in third world countries.  And in the US living standards for the poor are falling and the gap between rich and poor is increasing.  The US cannot afford universal health care, yet sanctuary cities attract unending streams of illegal immigrants.  Nobody can talk about the consequences without being called a racist.  So politicians tell little white lies, and democracy all form and no substance.<br/><br/>We need an end to illegal immigration and smaller family sizes."
763,SundayBusiness,"Ouch!  The last para really hurts.  <br/><br/>Neil, what you have (very cogently and correctly) said before it is that the US in particular has burned its raincoat, thrown away its umbrella, and with the recent tax cut is in the process of removing the roof so that all the sunshine can come pouring in.<br/><br/>Maybe one of the things that worries those dismal-science practitioners is the complete irresponsibility of both the Executive and the Legislative branch of the government of the largest economy, and guardian (sic) of the reserve currency, of the world?"
764,SundayBusiness,"Oil, natural gas, basic minerals, clean water are all becoming harder to get and more expensive.  Overpopulation, greater wealth in fewer hands, corrupt governments, fascism rising, air pollution, global warming........it doesn't take a PhD to figure out this can't continue for much longer without dire consequences."
765,SundayBusiness,"Its important to remember that a sovereign (central bank and Treasury) can never run out of money.  So any economic shock can be immediately counteracted by an increase in fiscal spending to make it a 4 day news cycle.  The solution is a Job Gty as part of a Full Employment Fiscal Policy.

766,SundayBusiness,"Economists thrive on pure doom.<br/>Disaster to them is perfume.<br/>They love to predict<br/>Financial conflict,<br/>And pull up their stats from the tomb."
767,SundayBusiness,"I'm 90% cash.  A big break is coming.  Wall Street sociopaths are playing chicken to get the last dollar of returns, and as the robber barons of the past always said - only a fool stays in for the last dollar."
768,SundayBusiness,"In all, the Trumpite/GOP has pushed the coming year's borrowing requirement toward $1.2 trillion.This means, in turn, that the bond pits will be flooded with $1.8 trillion of ""homeless"" treasury paper after accounting for $600 billion of the Fed's QT bond-dumping program.<br/><br/>Here's the thing. No one has ever tried---or even contemplated---financing $1.8 trillion or 8.8% of GDP at the tippy-top of a business cycle that will enter record territory (124 months) before FY 2019 is over.<br/><br/>Indeed, the very idea of it is pure madness and it will shatter the entire Bubble Finance order before it is done.<br/><br/>So what looms just ahead is a flood of government paper into the bond pits which will be 9X bigger(relative to GDP) than was the case at the last cycle peak on the eve of the financial crisis.<br/><br/>Besides, the Chinese were still buying Treasury paper hand-over-fist back then. By contrast, among the many wars the Donald has on his mind is the trade war with the Red Ponzi that has now gone into full tit-for-tat. This week has already generated a 179% Chinese levy on US sorghum and a pending US levy on steel automotive wheels, and apparently they are just getting warmed up.<br/><br/>The same is true of the eurozone.<br/><br/>The $1.8 trillion of homeless US treasury paper in the bond pits is not an aberration and it's not isolated. After the worldwide central bank money printing binge of the last decade, which t0ok combined balance sheets from $5 trillion to $22 trillion, it's a universal condition."
769,SundayBusiness,"We should all be gloomy.  Climate change.  Mass extinction.<br/><br/>10,000,000,000 people by 2050.<br/><br/>We waste resources like we have a spare Earth in our back pocket.<br/><br/>We are all running, blind folded and humming a stupid song, towards a cliff."
770,SundayBusiness,To answer your headline in one word..... income inequality. 
771,SundayBusiness,"What a wonderful economy!  In the U.S. 40 million people live in poverty.  How much better than that can it get?<br/><br/>It seems like the author, the World Bank and the IMF use economic metrics that measure everything but what happens in non-rich people's lives."
772,SundayBusiness,"The wealth of the world is an illusion, it is all debt. How much corporate debt is there, more than 2007. How much government debt is there, a lot more than 2007. How much private debt is there, very much more than 2007. How much job security is there, a lot less than 2007. The central banks have created a bubble, a much bigger bubble than 2007. Hoping I survive when, not if, it pops."
773,SundayBusiness,"Folks need to understand that every year of economic  growth brings less forests, less fish in the ocean, poorer quality oil to extract, depleted soil, more mouths to feed.     Not to mention more crowded and paved over cities that magnify the effect of natural disasters. This all has a way of constraining growth. "
774,SundayBusiness,"Even if I understood all the economic complexities, what could I do about it? Does this current information tell me whether I should make a big purchase or start a new small business concern or wait? I might as well study the Book of Revelation or again seek out the esoteric counsels of my corner fortune-teller, who sees dark clouds in my future btw."
775,SundayBusiness,Policimakers have to look ALWAYS gloomy in order to have peopleâs attention. The same with media.
776,SundayBusiness,"the so called ""middle class"" is all but extinct as the rich get richer and the poor are fed a false hope"
777,SundayBusiness,"I can tell you why I would be gloomy:  It is because the leader of the world's largest economy is a loose cannon.  He zigs, then he zags, then he lies and then lies about his lies.  How are the world economies supposed to plan when there is chaos at the top of our political and economic structure?<br/>I would be asking:  America what have you done?  When is it going to stop?  You are not only damaging yourself, you are hurting the rest of us as well."
778,SundayBusiness,"They are nervous because they realize wealth of the world in a few hands is disastrous long term for the world economy. Especially, when it is being driven by corrupt leaders who are trying to shift towards dictatorships. We already know where this is going when it is revealed it is another ponzi scheme. The only hope is that this time the people will not fall for it and bail out the wealthy again."
779,SundayBusiness,I'd add aging demographics in the developed countries as a major biggie.
780,SundayBusiness,"Two things to remember when considering the so-called ""gloomy"" outlook:<br/>1. Paul Samuelson's observation that ""Economists have correctly forecast nine of the last five recessions"".<br/>2. Lagarde and Obstfeld have long been negative about the world's economic outlook. Why should they change now?"

784,SundayBusiness,"I basically agree you.  Sometimes I do wonder about this idea of the new bubble, or what some people call ""the asset bubble of every asset."" Consider this:  I'm in a very high priced area of the SF Bay Area.  And yet my allegedly over-inflated home has only gone up about 3% per year over the last 20 years.  Granted, that's largely because of the 2007/08 real estate melt down.  But a bunch of my stocks are similar.  But even if you are wrong about the ""biggest bubble in history"" there is no doubt you are correct about fanning the flames of already ridiculously extreme and harmful income and asset inequality."
785,SundayBusiness,"Maybe true in the very long term, but in the past 20 years an enormous segment of the global population has risen out of poverty (giving them increasing ability to buy stuff), and that trend is ongoing led by countries in Asia and, more recently, Africa.<br/><br/>I think trends such as stagnant wages for middle class and poor people that are present in the US are absent on average when you consider the global population."
786,SundayBusiness,"That's definitely true in the US, but globally an enormous segment of the population has risen out of poverty, and this trend is ongoing fueled by growth in Asia, and, more recently, Africa.<br/><br/>I think it's true that globally the extremely rich are getting richer. But the US is kind of an anomaly in that poor people and middle class incomes have stagnated. And even here, in the past year it seems like wages are finally rising. "
787,SundayBusiness,"Levi do you know that over $3 TRILLION of that $21.7 TRILLION debt is owed to the FED which returns the interest on it to the Treasury? <br/><br/>Do you realize that about 5 TRILLION of it is owed to other branches of the federal gov, so that that debt is merely an accounting fiction. (Actually the whole debt is merely an accounting fiction since we can create as much money as we want, but I won't live long enough to explain that to you.)<br/><br/>Levi, do you realize that a million dollars in today's economy means a lot less than a million in 1946 or 1835? If you want to impress us with how big the debt is, you have to look at the debt ratio, debt/GDP. The debt ratio outside the federal gov is about 74%.<br/><br/>It was 109% in 1946. 47% higher than today's. <br/><br/>Did that rob the next generation of their future? No, in the next 27 years have GDP growth averaged 3.8% and real median household income surged 74%. (If you want to raise the ""Europe was Rubble Myth,"". look at <a href=""http://piketty.pse.ens.fr/files/capital21c/en/pdf/F1.1.pdf"" title=""http://piketty.pse.ens.fr/files/capital21c/en/pdf/F1.1.pdf"" target=""_blank"">http://piketty.pse.ens.fr/files/capital21c/en/pdf/F1.1.pdf</a> which shows that the output of Europe was about the same as the US in the Great Prosperity 1946 - 1973).<br/><br/>Did we pay down that enormous debt? No, we had deficits for 21 years out of the 27 and INCREASED the debt in dollars 75%.<br/><br/>Well, what happened to that huge debt? Since we invested in America, the economy grew so much, the debt became insignificant."

789,Foreign,We are living in complex world. We need to understand Responsible states  v/s Irresponsible states.<br/>UN can define who are irresponsible states and finds way to curb them . Leadership is all about freedom to public or not . A dictator can never be a leader of a  responsible state 
790,Foreign,"I predict that President Trump will get a brilliant agreement from North Korea (the best one in history), one that calls for complete de-nuclearization of the peninsula and, most importantly, one that is far, far better than anything Obama or Clinton could obtain.

So many people have been jumping down President Trumps throat over his comments, his firings, his morally bankrupt personal behavior, etc. that maybe the President now wants to accomplish some great things like more peace in the world especially a needed thing to help him and Republicans stay in control of Congress and White House.  In the meantime we hope President Trump will not forget the Syrian Democratic Forces and the reemerging new limited version of the kingdom of Greater Syria as we are now calling for Iran, Hezbollah and Russia to leave Syria.

794,Learning,I think that we get pressured to do good on the test and we over think the problem. We get all stressed out over doing good that we just get a horrible grade. Also when other people are saying that the test is easy it makes you rethink your intelligence and everything you studied on. Everytime a teacher says you have to pass this test or it will affect you badly. I get stressed out on trying to do my best that i overthink questions. 
795,Learning,"Standardized testing is seen as a very important part of every students high school career. Teachers, parents, administrators, and most importantly colleges encourage you to study hard, and strive to do the very best you can because in the end it is all about that one number. High schools give many standardized test in order to place students on an academic ladder so that they can properly place scholarships and figure out weather a student is college or career ready. I feel that for the most part standardized testing is an accurate representation of a students knowledge. Two  things I would change about standardized testing is the amount of test each student is pushed to take before graduation and the time limit put on students. I think that they should create one test that accurately determines the knowledge gained by that student and leave at that. hen you start over testing students it makes it harder to focus on one test and students begin to put less effort into each test they take. The time restraint on most standardized test does not accurately assess students knowledge because it is harder for slower readers to finish each section of the test including math."
796,Learning,"I do feel pressure from my teachers, administrators, parents, and peers to perform well on these tests because they want to look good too. Although the test reflects our abilities, it also reflects their performance as well. Therefore, the pressure is on us to do well. For me personally, I tend to overstress myself and cause more pressure upon myself to do well on these sorts of tests. However, the high school student is most likely already going through some sort of problem in life that causes stress, and the tests just cause more stress. I feel that standardized tests are a good thing, but having so many in one year can be too much; especially if students are missing classes here and there just to prep for these tests. It's not fair to teachers or students. In my opinion, the material these tests cover, reflects how well we are doing academically, but the time circumstances that students deal with are not fair. Students work at different paces, and just because one student does not have enough time to finish his/her test, does not mean he/she does not know the material. Time restraints cause an immense amount of pressure on the students which can cause lower test scores. If standarized tests did not have time restraints, students would be able to perform better.Â "
797,Learning,"I am a high school junior in Walhalla, SC and the amount of tests juniors have to take are unbelievable. My peers and I are constantly taken out of class, losing valuable learning time, to take tests that lasts all day and is almost in no way an accurate measurement of our skills. The pressure to do well on these tests come from the desire to get into college, because our scores are supposed to reflect how well we will do once we get there. Our school expects us to do our best and make high scores so our work reflects their accomplishments in accurately preparing us for life after high school. The number of tests we have to take should be lesser than they are now, because students should be able to focus on their current classes rather than prepping for the next standardized test. There should be better ways to measure students skills and potential outside high school. "
798,Learning,"At Walhalla HIgh School there are multiple standardized tests that Juniors have to take. As a Senior looking back I felt that there was too much testing, which led to a stressful environment. Not caused from a sense of pressure to succeed by administration, but from a lack of âfree time.â The administration, to their best, tries to create and foster a stress free environment, instead, the amount of testing causes absences from from class, in my case AP classes. Leading to conflicts and makeups for the classes missed. Even though I dislike the cause of standardized testing, the results from them allow other post-high school institutions to assess students. Although with some accuracy, one student might not be the greatest tester but another is able to select the correct answer. Both could have very different knowledge levels and the test would reflect their knowledge conversely. Despite standardized testing not being able to assess student completely accurately, they are the best way to judge students knowledge, as a whole."
799,Learning,"Although I am a black female who resides in  Philadelphia, the color of my skin doesn't change my opinion on the incident that occurred earlier this week at Starbucks. What those men went through sent a feeling of heartache through me. I believe that the police officers and Starbucks' employees could have been more solution-oriented and payed more attention to what the men were saying. I  believe that this situation portrayed the racial bias that many people hold in that area because of the rash and thoughtless way the men were handled. Starbucks'    decision to close its stores sets a great example to other stores that have had similar instances occur. Reading about other's experiences opened my eyes to how close incidents like this happen around me. Even though steps are being taken to eliminating racism for good, for every step we take forward, we always take three steps backwards, I hope that one day African Americans can stand near police officers without fearing being irrationally arrested."
800,Weekend,"Thank you for the uplifting story of what Ms. Smith and Ms. Woodson are doing for us.  The power of literature and poetry to change lives cannot be underestimated.  Those who treat education as a commodity and a business don't understand this. In a broken world, a fractured society, literature and poetry has the power to heal because they foster empathy and understanding of our human condition.   "
801,Weekend,These women give me hope.   
802,Well,"Susan,<br/>We share the same first name. I met you in Dekalb, IL, at a graduate student conference in 1995; you gave the keynote presentation. You were so generous with your time to new scholars and so kind to this star-struck and nervous graduate student, sitting in on my presentation. You wanted to know what *we* were working on and thinking about. You have had such a tremendous influence on scholars of women's writing. I treasure my copy of The Madwoman in the Attic, which you signed. <br/><br/>You are still so giving to others and still teaching us all. I am ill with autoimmune illness and am a wheelchair user who's at home. I've had the joys of raising children, but work weeks can be lonely and painful. You are so right that joyous caregiving enriches our lives; it's a form of activism that teaches others to care as well (rather than walking away as many do).<br/><br/>I wish you the best on this difficult journey and want you to know how much you've touched my life, my thinking, and my writing.<br/><br/>Susan"

804,Arts&Leisure,"As another reader stated, this was a beautiful interview and the only thing that could have made it better was a videoed companion.<br/><br/>Reading their words and actions was wonderful, however this was a great opportunity to not only read about two generations coming together, but to also witness the differences and nuances that these to men have. Especially seeing that so many people have compared MBJ to a young DW. <br/><br/>I was deeply moved by the piece and the camaraderie that was expressed. I was reminded of an older uncle coming back home to talk to his nephew about life. MBJ held his own in this conversation and I can only hope that his star continues to rise and shine brighter."
805,Arts&Leisure,"I've loved MBJ since ""The Wire"", but really fell for him in ""Friday Night Lights"".  (How do you not mention his acting in one of the best TV series in recent history?) His character grew so much over those last seasons.  But I truly could not move or speak after watching him in ""Fruitvale Station."" What a devastating story and he gave us such an insight into who Oscar Grant was. <br/><br/>Denzel has two Oscars and I applaud that, but he was robbed of one.  He should have won for ""Philadelphia.""  Tom Hanks' character has way less of an arc than Denzel's.  There is no movie without  his character's homophobia, disgust and fear and watching it turn to understanding, love and respect.  Denzel is the heart of that movie.   <br/><br/>Thank you for featuring two wonderful actors.  Many of us look forward to watching them for many years to come."
806,Arts&Leisure,My first recollection of Michael B Jordan was on the soap opera All My Children. You could see he had a presence even on that. Iâm happy for his success.  
807,Arts&Leisure,"A little surprised that it wasn't discussed as part of the formative impact on MBJ's character development, but his role and impact on Friday Night Lights should not be understated.   Surrounded by outstanding actors and an excellent script that was very bold and innovative and non-judgmental in exploration of race relations, barriers to achievement, parenting, abuse, drug use in sports--even at the high school level--FNL, although not perfect, was a memorable achievement in television.  For those who have a bit of time to binge, and to see MBJ and other actors literally ""grow up"" and also define and refine their craft, FNL get the highest recommendation."
808,Arts&Leisure,"Michael B. Jordan is quite an actor.  I have accidentally seen all of his movies (meaning I did not seek them out) and in each one he captures your attention.  His debut performance in ""The Wire"" was incredibly riveting and ultimately heartbreaking in its sincerity.  Not sure how an actor extracts those emotions from the viewer without emoting himself but Jordan does.  There is an undefinable quietness about his performances.  Have not seen Black Panther yet but I bet his villain has that same understated intensity.  His move into production makes sense. Truly a young man to watch on all fronts. "
809,Arts&Leisure,"Wow!  I am shocked at Denzelâs responses to Michaelâs exuberance, consciousness, intelligence, and business oriented approach to the industry.  I am so impressed with MBJ and I hope that he never gets discouraged by older generations downplaying his efforts and thinking it is funny.  Kudos Michael B Jordan and I still love you Denzel but, if you say you are passing the torch, donât drop it intentionally before the next runner can get it from you.... "
810,Arts&Leisure,"Mr. Washington is truly one of the greatest actors to graced the screen and stage with his formidable talent. I'm glad to see he has played such an aspirational role in the talented Mr. Jordan's life.<br/><br/>I hope these two wonderful actors and Mr. Jordan's production company will do films illuminating the lives of historically significant but largely forgotten black Americans and the challenges they faced and may or may not have overcome. There are already fine bio-epic films about Martin Luther King, Malcolm X and Nat Turner (his rebellion anyway), but none to my knowledge about Frederick Douglas, Harriet Tubman, Sojouner Truth, Hiram Revels, Ned Cobb, Charles Houston, W.E.B. Du Bois, Harriette and Harry Moore, Fred Hampton and George Jackson. Depicting their and other forgotten black American lives would help educate all but the most hardcore race haters that the Civil War did not end racism in this country. In fact, if anything, racism worsened during and after Reconstruction. While the Civil Rights Movement resulted in limited remedial measures, they failed to end de facto segregation and racist abuse of black Americans. And now white supremacy is again rearing its ugly, ignorant head--led by the White House!<br/><br/>I realize that these two great actors can only do so much and it's unreasonable to expect them to do more than they've already done, especially Denzel. Alas such is the unfairness of the moral burden of those possessing the power, influence and decency to do good."
811,Arts&Leisure,As if I needed further reason to admire Mr. Washington...
812,Arts&Leisure,"For decades I have felt that Mr. Washington is the greatest actor in the English-speaking world. <br/><br/>I hope he does ""King Lear"". I hope he does ""Richard III"". "
813,Arts&Leisure,"I enjoyed reading Mr. Washington and Mr. Jordan's conversation immensely. I hope the Times will continue to produce articles such as this one that highlight all generations and circumstances of African Americans. As a white, female Millennial living in a prosperous, progressive, but essentially all-white town, articles such as these are sometimes the only exposure the majority race has to everyone else's reality.<br/><br/>Keep educating, keep exposing. "
814,Arts&Leisure,The one thing I took away from the conversation about success is we never get there by ourselves.  There are so many people that help and mentor us along the way.  Cheers to Denzel and Mike they are adding to our creative culture in a very positive way.  Break a leg Denzel!
815,Arts&Leisure,"I think you have missed the point Monty. Nobody's perfect. Not men, not women. And the remark is also somewhat self deprecating."
816,Arts&Leisure,Ditto!
817,Arts&Leisure,"Denzel did Richard III at Shakespeare in the Park, probably 25-30 years ago."

819,Travel,"My wife and I have been fortunate enough to visit some of the beautiful and desolate landscapes in the vicinity.  For a lifelong Midwesterner, being able to see terrain like this is awe-inspiring.  With so little vegetation, vistas are wide open and the land forms are laid bare.  One can see the results of natural forces at work over the millennia.  <br/><br/>The most precious commodity out there is the type of solitude the author describes.   Drilling rigs, cell towers, noisy trucks, and other human development may be good for the local economy, but there should still be places that are left alone.  <br/><br/>Our country is blessed with natural places that are our nation's crown jewels.  Once they are destroyed, we can't get them back."
820,Travel,"If you are going to make the trek to this ""middle of no where"" locale, I'd suggest going just a bit further north and east to Great Basin National Park. It is far more scenic. There are several groves of trees millenniums old, there is a huge cave system, plus alpine forests, peaks, and lakes.   One this both places have are amazing views of the Milky Way. "

Of course back then no agents were waiting to arrest them but was still a good idea to get a stay of deportation BEFORE the interview."
823,National,I have been married a few times and can still answer the relevant questions about each marriage. These questions seem fair to me.

826,National,"I join several others in classifying this story as another propaganda against our law enforcement whether immigration or not.<br/><br/>Why have the laws if you make exceptions to everybody.<br/><br/>When asked to leave, you refuse.  The law says the government will deport at its expense and not that of a deportee.<br/><br/>You still do not leave.<br/><br/>The deportation order has no sunset clause - I am no lawyer - but I think an arrest warrant also has no sunset.<br/><br/>I lived in London last year for 6 months - a period that as an American - they allow you to stay there without a formal visa.<br/><br/>Brits now have a policy that to rent an apartment, you have to prove your legal status.<br/><br/>With my U.S. passport lacking a ""chop"" for 6 months - it was not going to be possible.<br/><br/>But then, the lawyers concluded that a 6 month lease can be signed with copies of my passport and entry stamp as a proof.<br/><br/>After a wonderful stay - I left that country 6 months to the day I had arrived.<br/><br/>Follow the law and America will also treat you right."

832,Travel,"I havenât been to Lisbon since the early-1970s, when I was a teenager! But I remember the delicious food â fish course, followed by meat course. The wide boulevards like âLiberty Avenue,â and old section on the city. And the side trips to beautiful Obidos, Cascais, Estoril. "
833,Travel,"Lisbon and Portugal, in general, are among the best places I've ever visited. I've been to the country five times and can't wait to go back. I expected the article to mention Mercado da Ribeira, a renovated large warehouse-like structure lined by myriad restaurants, where you can have excellent and affordable food. It can get really crowded sometimes, to the point when it's hard to find a seat at one of the several large tables that are supposed to be shared.  "
834,Travel,"I'm surprised you didn't mention La UNICA Fabbrica de Pasteis de Belem.  I mean, if you're going there and not getting a half dozen tarts, then WHY?  Yes, you can get pasteis de nata in Lisbon, as you noted, but this place is the original, and it bears all the traces of a romantic past.  Take the tram and enjoy. Also, while you're in Belem, check out the sculpture in honor of Henry IV the Navigator.  It's on the beach, and opposite the monastery.  Then get more pasteis."
835,Travel,They are very good but they are not the original - there isnât an âoriginalâ version. They are wonderful when freshly made but they are also not the best. Depending on your preferences youâll find very ones. My personal favorite is at Pastelaria Benard in Chiado. You can also look up the yearly winner of the âBest Pastel de Nataâ competition which takes place every year. 
836,Travel,"Excellent recommendation on the monument of the discoveries. It is set on a gigantic plaza with a world map (gift of South Africa) detailing the amazing discoveries set in motion by Henry the navigator. A good reminder of how the Portuguese discovered the world. It is worth going up the tower, the views are unmatched from the top."
837,Travel,"The fado scene is pretty sad, like the music. If you go to a fado house, you may be the only guests there. However, if you can see Mariza, do so. Also, there are lots of artists from Cabo Verde, Angola and Mozambique."

841,Metro,Itâs the famous joke:  New Jersey is the only state you have to pay to be allowed out.
842,Metro,"When the City decided to make the Toll on one way I knew this would happen.  Would people complain had the fare been $8.00 each way? The big problem is you can always expect to be backed up on the staten Island Expressway. No mater the time of day there is always a bottle neck for couple of miles. Someone had a great Idea few years back to make a Bus lane. Construstion tied up the Expressway for over a year the lane goes about 2 miles,not the entire lenghth of the expressway. The battery tunnel toll is $8.50 cash $5.76 EZ-Pass so the roads leading to the Brooklyn bridge is always backed up.  Geez I remember 50 cents toll for the Verrazano bridge and 35 cents for the battery tunnel. Everything is more in NY."
843,Metro,"It is sad that even discussion about an article about toll prices devolves into us vs them. Staten Islanders vs non-Staten Islanders. Drivers vs Public Transit Users. EZ Pass vs Non EZ Pass. New York City vs Non-New York City. Why must it always come down to us vs them? Aren't there fair solutions to every problem? Or is it more enjoyable to tear ""them"" apart? Every time you tear down  or insult a fellow American, Russia wins. Every time."
844,Metro,"It is only tolled one way, into SI, and residents pay $6.25.   Those other bridges are tolled in both directions.  "
845,Metro,"It's so much higher because it's tolled in only one direction, unlike the others you mentioned.<br/><br/>And the 59th St Bridge needs to be tolled to reduce all traffic on both sides."

848,OpEd,Thank you Mr Blow! For not being swayed by this apology book tour that Comey is on. 
849,OpEd,"Comey held a press conference that was not his job to do, solely so that he could editorialise on his disappointment that no criminal behaviour was found so no indictment would be forthcoming.  He conducted one investigation in public, and kept the other secret.  Then he used his office to give him a platform to opine about a fact-free nothingburger days before the election.<br/>His excuse? He thought sheâd win anyway.  (Otherwise he might not have.) So, that means itâs ok to... what? Pile on? Take it upon yourself to take her down a peg?<br/>Thatâs the classic excuse of a bully:  aw, I didnât mean no harm, and anyway sheâs tough, she can take it...<br/>What a vile person.  Mildly nauseated? He makes me retch. <br/><br/>Oh, and folks are right â Clinton didnât handle the email thing correctly.  She should have pointed out, every time, that her predecessors at State did the exact same thing; that one third to half the members of Congress also use private emails for government business; and said that if she became prez sheâd institute a government-wide review of such practices.  After all, if itâs a national security concern then it applies to all branches with access to sensitive information, and Iâm sure everyone agrees that everyone needs to be treated just the same..."
850,OpEd,"Trump is despicable and Comey is a unlikeable.  Obama reminded us that we can do more than one thing at a time; Trump is teaching us that we can viscerally dislike many people at the same time. We all have within a deep reserve of dislike given the right stimuli.<br/><br/>DJT is in the WH because HRC (and her disgraced and disgraceful husband) used a corrupt DNC to steal a nomination to which they felt entitled. HRC was the only democrat who could have lost to Trump, and DJT was the only republican who could have lost to Hillary. And in the end that is what happened and the world is much the worse for it all. All the rest is interesting folderol. The DNC - especially he superdelegates - sold us down the river to the Clintons. Ultimately they are responsible for this debacle but of course will never accept the blame. In the end we may be better off if a consequence is the destruction of the Republican Party which itself has devolved to a slimy despicable pox on the USA and the planet earth. <br/><br/>God help us."

852,OpEd,"In the 1960s, Psychologist Lawrence Kohlberg identified six stages of moral development. Stages one (avoiding punishment) and two (Whatâs in it for me?), were most commonly displayed by children. In stages three and four, people try to conform to social norms and laws. Those that reach stages five and six, according to Kohlberg, move beyond a blind allegiance to laws, and seek instead to construct a morality based on universal principles, and to live by it.<br/><br/>Iâd put Trump at stage two and Comey at stage four. And while I agree with Comeyâs rather obvious insight that Trump is morally unfit to lead, I would say the same about him. Like other stage fours, Comey is, Iâm sure, a man of integrity, but heâs arrogant and lacks wisdom and perspective. Iâm disappointed that such a man was ever appointed to such a high position."
853,OpEd,"The Republicans are that very adept child who consistently cries about unfair treatment in the press (playing the refs) and the Democrats, unfledgingly trying to be fair, always let them have the last word. <br/><br/>A recent case in point is this amazingly silly notion of the âdeep state,â which is so far from reality that it pains me to see the Democrats letting them utter the term. It is ridiculous. Next time have them lay out for you what they mean by the â deep state,â so we can laugh aloud. <br/><br/>It is amazing that the under represented had a champion named Obama, and Republicans have many convinced heâs for the big guy. <br/><br/>Itâs amazing how stupid both sides think the American people are. Perhaps not?"
854,Culture,"I saw 1000 Nights and One Day.  It is one of the most surprising, genuinely innovative pieces of theatre I have encountered.  As it begins, you think you are going to watch a postmodern deconstruction of Sheherezade, with the pasha as a befuddled Jewish millennial, and the eponymous heroine as a spunky QUeen Hester.  But hold on to your seats.  Suddenly youâre in modern-day Manhattan and ancient Persia simultaneously; the stories of the clash of Western and Middle Eastern civilization seem to be inevitably bound up with your own; you find yourself trapped in a matrix of inescapable narratives which permit you to feel that you are captain of your own ship, but which ultimately determine your course with merciless certitude.  The real is indistinguishable from fiction, and the conflicting narratives permeate each other like the diaphanous curtains that tenuously separate the areas of the stage. Music is used in astonishingly inventive ways to weave the various threads that come together to create the story of the couple, as they strive to free themselves from the unforgiving web. <br/><br/>Take it from me, there are important things going on here.  See it."

879,Politics,Trump tells us Comey released the Clinton memo because he thought Hillary would win. Trump states Comey wanted a job. This is clear evidence that Trump isnât smart and that critical thinking is not a part of his mental arsenal. Why would Clinton employ a man who put negative information out before an election?  If Comey wanted a job with Trump he would have refused to pursue the Russia theme. Trump continues to embarrass himself on a daily basis. 
880,Politics,"Comey,  despite his protestations to the contrary, sowed enough doubts in the electorate(especially voting age women and black  voters), that HR Clinton was a liar, irresponsible in handling security matters, amoral and a cheat, by giving credence to the e-mail charges as to make them possibly criminal. He played a larger part in influencing the election than any FBI DIRECTOR since Hoover. That said Clinton won the election by 3,000,000 votes and the debate should be shifted to the validity of the electoral college in which two republican presidents, Bush and  Trump , failed to win the popular vote even if 3rd party candidates were added to their score. There in lies the crime, when a citizens vote in North and South Dakota ,Wyoming  can count up 50 time more than a Citizen of Calif, Texas and NY, and when the electors are not legally bound to  vote for the candidate they have pledged to.  Comey did his best to throw the election to Trump and the electoral college did the rest. Trumps's hatred and  for Comey  comes not  from his 'election meddling' but his support and independence in dealing with the Russian investigation, and trump's own finacial crimes , lies and kleptocratic  behaviors."
881,Politics,It is quite disturbing that I feel the need to shield my seven year old from the communications of our president.
882,Politics,"Yes, Mr. Comey has his faults. But Mr. Trump has so many vulnerabilities at this point that its almost a TKO. He has lost any semblance of credibility, his only defense consisting of ""fake news"", ""many people have said ..."", no press conferences (only campaign rallies), tweets based on Fox News biased reporting, abrupt eruptions about his persecution when discussing war, etc. etc. Mr. Trump is unfit to be POTUS and a danger to our country. "
883,Politics,"I leave it to others to decide whether or not Comey's book is appropriate, or whether he was guilty of politicizing the election.  But it doesn't take a lawyer to see that Trump, on a daily basis, deliberately and proudly displays his vast ignorance and his thuggish approach to ""governing"" our once great and proud nation.  His vulgarity and his childish name-calling via the permanent, yet casual social media format cheapens the presidency, lowering it to standards never seen before.  <br/><br/>The next president will have to overcome a nation's disdain for the presidency reminiscent of the disgust left behind after the Nixon administration.  But while the full extent of Nixon's abhorrent behavior came to light slowly, with some tapes unavailable for years after his presidency, Trump's mountain of lies and voluminous puerile tweets are immediately available to all via television interviews, speeches and of course, Twitter - where nothing is forever deleted.  How anyone could approve of Trump's schoolyard taunts, so unbecoming in any adult, let alone the President of the United States, is beyond me.  "

885,Politics,"It never fails: the so-called president constantly and consistently uses epithets to describe precisely his own worst characteristics. This is so transparent it would be laughable if he weren't, unfortunately, in the White House, where he can do and has done so much damage."
886,Politics,"I'm not sure why this is news, much less open to comments. <br/><br/>Donald Trump's long and shabby record of lying is legendary.

He can't understand why anyone would hold him accountable for being a liar if it gets him what he wants, which is fame and fortune. In other words, he hasn't yet fully grasped the fact that he won the election and is president. This is why he is still in campaign mode, which was the fun part he refused to let go of."
891,Politics,"Reader in Wash, DC:  I guess that the FBI could not prove that Hillary Clinton repeatedly lied, because they found her guilty of no wrong-doing.  If the FBI had proof of any wrong-doing on her part, she would have been charged as such.  Clinton owes no apology, except perhaps to Bernie Sanders, who Clinton's DNC buddies (like Debbie Wasserman Shultz) disenfranchised.  Bernie Sanders would have made mincemeat out of trump."

895,Politics,"Yeah it's a good read, that one."
896,Politics,"From biographical evidence, your prediction is very accurate.  Biographers have noted that Trump would repeated lie, but then when he was ever under oath (during seemingly endless incidents of litigation), he would not perjure himself, even to the extent of completely contradicting his previous (false) statements.  The man's handlers and supporters have been phenomenally protective of their money-making, essentially side-show barker--perhaps until now..."

Amber is not who would've come to mind when seeing an article that speaks on such a pure and intuitive skill.  I've come across her latest ego-driven posts on social media spanning incessant marijuana promotion, a Huda Beauty rant, rage against another reader and also an aggressive confrontation with CitiBank.  Amber seems to happily encourage her audience to destroy others at any given moment on a whim and it comes across as blatant cyber-bullying which is a major concern for me and many others. It's not always the popular choice to speak out but when you have this type of platform, you're responsible for how you choose to use it.

Until then, he'll collect a comfortable salary as a lobbyist or consultant. Ryan is only 48. That gives him almost three decades to wait things out.

919,Editorial,"A reasonable person reading the history laid out in this editorial would have to conclude that every well-meaning program to end housing discrimination has utterly failed.  Yes, some neighborhoods have become better integrated, but housing integration lags behind minority participation in the market in other areas that did not experience government intervention, and minority home ownership is no better than 50 years ago.  Before government intervention in the 1960s we had a rising Black middle class.  The full negative impact of government intervention is even worse than articulated here.  Government policies actually encouraged the issuance of expensive loans to people who could not afford a house and contributed to the collapse of the housing market and the onset of the Great Recession.  If the market had been allowed to work, over time the rationality of the market would have overcome prejudices.  This is why large corporation today are among the most inclusive organizations in the world.  But you say that allowing discrimination to be eradicated over time is not morally acceptable; that we must act to end it now.  The argument is appealing, but it is completely undermined by experience.  Advocates for government intervention have been making the same argument for 50 years, and their urgency has proven counterproductive. The history of the past 50 years has completely destroyed any moral basis for government intervention in the housing market."

It is much more difficult, if not impossible, to follow the orders of the hateful liberals* and ""move to where the jobs are"" if you are upside down in a mortgage.<br/><br/>The USA and Spain were both hammered badly by the housing debacle.  Curiously, both had much higher than usual percentages of home ownership.  As home ownership moved back down towards more historic levels so did unemployment.  Not stating there is a definite correlation---but it is curious.<br/><br/>A home can be an anchor in a community.  It can also be an albatross around ones neck.  Furthermore, not everyone has a fixed rate mortgage.<br/><br/>The problem is that millions of people fell for the blatant lie that a ""home is your best investment.""  No.  A home is a building.  A place to live.  It should not be viewed as an investment.<br/><br/>*Most liberals (of which I am included) are not hateful.

The latter group is vanishingly small compared to the former. And the only reason the former is still unaware of this, is because the bills to pay are just now emerging. Once they're paying out the nose, and sacrificing even minimum services for this Ponzi scheme, liberalism and progressivism are going to be tarnished for a generation. <br/><br/>If liberals can get in front of this (and I believe we can, being mostly rational), we can probably turn things around.

Anyone who has made hundreds of thousands of dollars a year, should have provided well for themselves.  States should reduce the amount of pension for anyone making more than $150,000 a year.

Trump's advice to Billy Bush - "" Just tell them and they'll believe it"" appears to be working on the uninformed and gullible public. BTW,  I suppose that Trump will announce that the large stockpile of US chemical weapon will be destroyed since chemical weapons are an anathema to Trump. Also, Is it permissible for Assad to use chemical weapons on ISIS remnants. Apparently so since Trump praised Saddam for using gas on terrorists and was ""really good at killing "" them. "

But we do know that, in the past, UN inspectors accused both sides of using outlawed chemical weapons in Syria.<br/>Above all, what are the repercussions of our military actions in Syria? The increasingly radical Islamist government of Turkey, portraying itself as the champion of Sunni Islam and Turkish nationalism, invaded huge swaths of Kurdish Syria. The US military pulled back to avoid conflict with the advancing Turkish forces.<br/>Talking about the Turks, our ""mission accomplished"" in Iraq, may have eased the path of the increasingly anti-American Islamist government of Turkey!<br/>Consider the situation in Syria BEFORE the United States and its Sunni Muslim allies of the Gulf began supporting the Syrian rebels. The country had a growing economy and all religious groups lived in relative harmony. The government was corrupt and highly authoritarian, but have our efforts to helped or hurt the situation in Syria? What about the millions of Syrian Christians or other people displaced by the war?<br/>Maybe it would be good to think before acting ... for a change!"
953,Foreign,"The war in Syria is almost over. Assad has about 65% of the country, the Kurds  have about 25% and Al-Qaeda and the Turkish-backed rebels have about 10% between them. <br/><br/>There is no reason whatsoever for America to intervene against Assad at this stage in the game. Saudi Arabia's attempt to overthrow Assad and replace him with a friendly Wahhabi government failed. Qatar and Turkey's attempt to overthrow Assad and replace him with a government friendly towards their pipeline project failed. The Russians will keep their bases and the Iranians will keep a government friendly towards them and hostile towards Israel.  <br/><br/>I understand why we are still there. We are there to keep both Turkey and the Syrian government from attacking the Kurds. The Kurds made many sacrifices to defeat ISIS and the US military does not want to abandon them to either Assad or the Turks. I give the Pentagon credit for that, because it shows that at least our armed forces are still somewhat honorable. <br/><br/>We can and should punish Assad for the use of chemical weapons by his forces. Moreover, it is important for the Western Allies to demonstrate to Germany, Japan, and the world's other democracies that they still stand for an international order where the use of such weapons is not tolerated. <br/><br/>It is nice, too, to see the old Allies together again and acting in concert. The solution to the rise of the dictators might very well be a league of democracies of sorts. "
954,Foreign,"Let me understand this one.<br/><br/>You telegraph a missile strike and then hit three facilities known to be involved with the associated offense, in this case chemical weapons.<br/><br/>Who does not think Syria, Russia and Iran knew these missiles were coming and the US, Britain and France knew that ""they knew."" <br/><br/>I love ""deep reporting"" from America's Media!"
955,Foreign,"Simple solution for Assad: just claim 'false intelligence' then media and the international community - similar to Bush/Cheney, who killed millions, will let you off the hook; release you from all responsibility."
956,Foreign,"For the thousandth time, the US should install its nuclear weapons in Poland, Ukraine, and Taiwan."
957,Foreign,"We have no idea of the Truth or falsity of the chemical attack that came from Syria save our governments say so or the accuracy of the Pentagon's statement.  Times outlined there are no good U.S. options in a prior post.   This option in long run probably won't do any good even if it does hit Syria's chemical weapons.   However, it makes a political point strengthened by involving U.S. allies, GB and France.  It is disappointing if this was done with support of Iran and Russia&lt; I would have thought they were more civilized.  Why Assad solely among states needs chemical weapons in a war he is winning is beyond me."
958,Foreign,"He should have done this the last time. But he didn't really do it this time; I've<br/>a strong hunch Mattis, and others, planned it. The whole world is scared about this loony in residence at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave.. And he's got almost three years to go."
959,Foreign,"âThe United States and its allies continue to demonstrate blatant disregard for international law,"" and Russia and its allies continue to demonstrate blatant disregard for the Geneva Protocols. <br/><br/>Just as Syria and North Korea collaborated on a plutogenic nuclear reactor, so was North Korea crucial to Syria's chemical weapons supply chain. Iran and north Korea have moreover collaborated on the development of ICBMs. <br/><br/>Russia doesn't believe there could be any international laws coming to bare on human rights, only on national sovereignty. They see human rights as a cynical ruse for the transaction of geopolitics. <br/><br/>Saddam Hussein and Muammar Gaddafi played crucial roles in american geopolitics. Hussein was the stop gap against Iranian ambitions for regional hegemony. Removing Hussein allowed Iran and its security partners to coordinate an ethnic cleansing and genocide against the Syrian people. We used Gaddafi in a sting operation to uncover the rogue state nuclear weapon supply chain.<br/><br/>These guys were also human rights abusers, and the US seemed to suffer a cost in soft power through their association with them. We deposed them or allowed them to be deposed. Russia pays no soft power price for defending human rights abusers, so they defend their most insidious security partners tooth and nail. And pay no soft power price. Are they right? Is there nothing beyond geopolitics? Should we have let Hussein gas his Shiite and Kurdish populations again? Is that the world we want?"
960,Foreign,"I am deeply skeptical about the effectiveness of this strike. It was small, and is being greeted by the Russians and Syrians as ""not serious."" This is hype from the Trump administration. Trump's ""Mission accomplished"" tells the tale. He wants this to generate a couple of points in the polls, and a distraction from the Comey narrative. <br/><br/>Wag the dog. Wag the dog. "
961,Foreign,Hmmmm.<br/> Mission accomplished.<br/> Where have I heard that before?
962,Foreign,"This is all theater.<br/><br/>The Assad government has been launching gas attacks pretty much unabated since 2012. There have been 8 to 11 gas attacks during Donald Trump's first year in office and 3 since the 2017 Shayrat airbase missile attack last year.<br/><br/>Furthermore, while gas attacks are terrible, the amount of deaths they have caused have been pretty minimal. By most estimates, at least 350,000 have been killed in the civil war, with at least 106,000 of those being civilians. Less than 2000 -- 1.8% -- of the deaths have been by gas.<br/><br/>This last attack was limited to two sites and was waged after telegraphing our intent for a week.<br/><br/>Methinks the death of the Syrian gas program has been greatly exaggerated.<br/><br/>It doesn't take a genius to figure out the when Syria launches a major gas attack, they weigh the risks and benefits and take measures to preserve their capabilities in anticipation of a limited attack by allied forces. So far, their planning seems to have worked."
963,Foreign,"The last time we heard a President say, ""Mission accomplished"" it was just the beginning our descent into the quagmire were still trying to extricate ourselves from in the region."
964,Foreign,"Point taken.  I should have added ""Or get out of Syria.""  We need some resolution to these crisis' , having Russia and Iran get away with supporting this monster is maddening."
965,Foreign,"Well said.  Neither Trump nor Obama nor Bush nor Clinton should have authorized bombs or missiles in the Middle East, and certainly we should not have authorized 'boots on the ground'.  <br/><br/>Why can't the Middle East settle its own problems?  Why doesn't the UN do something;  either do something or disband?  Why don't the EU countries plus UK, Norway and Switzerland remove the healthy, young male ex-pats from Syria and other mid-East countries and ship them back to fight for their own countries?  <br/><br/>From your mouth to God's ears:  ""The strength of America is in our own government, our own justice system, and the health, welfare, security and prosperity of our own people."""
966,Foreign,"I think Trump is incapable of being a strong, competent leader.  But ""that horrific pattern"" will end when both sides respond to diplomacy versus Tomahawk missiles.  Syria and Russia and Iran have yet to respond to diplomacy.  I'm for conversation versus war.  But do we allow the Syrian people to choke and die from chlorine and Sarin gas because you want to have a monologue versus stopping the use of such ""weapons"".  And that's what it is, a monologue.  Monologue by Trump, Obama, W.  Different POTUS, same result.  Assad gassing his own people."
967,SundayBusiness," It's been obvious for a long time that the signature for credit card purchases was meaningless. It has been years since I bothered to use my actual signature on the electronic pad rather than a fast squiggle to get out of the store quickly. <br/><br/> What consumers really need to do to protect themselves against fraud is to carefully review the charges that come through. The easiest way to do this is to make sure that you use charge cards that immediately send a text, an email, or both to you after a charge is processed.  That service was a game changer for me â â no longer any need to pore over monthly statements trying to reconcile them with physical receipts. "
968,SundayBusiness,"If someone steals my card and forges my signature, the forged signature is proof that I did not make the purchase. "
969,SundayBusiness,"When my daughter was in middle school, I taught her cursive. She spent a vast amount of her summer practicing writing out the alphabet and words to her favorite songs. Now that she is 18, whenever she has to sign paperwork (at the doctorâs office, for example) she uses cursive, and people are rather amazed that she knows how to actually sign her name. In my daily journaling, I still write in notebooks in cursive. It saddens me that this is soon to be a lost art. A signature, in many ways, defines a person. I cannot imagine the founding documents of this country absent the signatures of those who created them. "
970,SundayBusiness,"Glad to see it go, waste of time,"
971,SundayBusiness,America: welcome to the rest of the developed world. Where your signature is actually worth something when signed on contracts and not a useless requirement for buying snacks at Target. 
972,SundayBusiness,"I am okay with getting rid of signatures but we should add the ""PIN"" that most of the world uses in conjunction with ""Chip &amp; PIN"". Omitting signature without adding PIN will make things less secure and increase costs for card companies and customers."

974,SundayBusiness,"It's noticeable that most of the comments left here so far focus on purchasing transactions, as if that's the only possible purpose of a signature.<br/>   Your signature is one of the ways in which you represent yourself to others, which makes it a part of your identity. Even more, it's a part of how you stake your claim to that identity -- how you live that representation not only to others, but to yourself. That means it has value as a way of establishing and legitimizing your personal integrity -- your capacity to keep promises, for example.<br/>   When I was about 12 and wondering what to do to develop my signature, I deliberately patterned mine after my father's signature. Even a quick glance at our signatures side by side will show similarities to this day, even though he's long gone. Not only did this help me to improve my penmanship, mirroring his elegant, clear style, but it was one step into adulthood, a step that I somehow acknowledged in the back of my mind. Most importantly, it gave me lifetime ownership of a real link to my personal heritage, a recognition that I'm my father's son that I have always valued and will continue to value. I struggle to understand the views of those who see signatures as devoid of any possible significance other than for agreeing to payments."
975,SundayBusiness,"Still not sure what happens if one looses a credit card and it gets picked up by someone shady and used immediately on a purchase?<br/>We are missing a security layer without a signature requirement, or?<br/>And other countries chip systems require a âpinâ entered which is not mentioned in this article for the US system."
976,SundayBusiness,"The signature, in most of the cases cited in the article, falls just short of an oath. I am this person, the squiggles promise, and no other. I feel like I'm losing my identity further each passing day and each passe habit. I would sign this, if I could."
977,SundayBusiness,This chip reader system has been in place in Canada for years.  We even have an option just to tap your credit card on the machine to read the card to approve the transaction. It takes seconds. So convenient and safe.

979,SundayBusiness,"Signature or not, when you buy now with the card, you pay later with the creepy credit reporters like Shadowfax's greedier brother Equifax.<br/><br/>Make sure your favorite brick-and-mortar still accepts cash, and assume your purchase history's in the creeps' hands if you swipeâand that your contacts, GPS track, and browsing history are as well, if you wave your phone.<br/><br/>Don't be *as* worried if you pay with the same onlineâeven checks, let alone stray legal tender, can be stolen in transit.  I've seen it happen.  But avoid online banking, or at minimum keep separate send and receive accounts; and NEVER give PayPal and similar middlemen a bank account, only a credit card for them to charge (if that)."

As long as they can pass along the costs of fraud to merchants and customers things will remain the same."
982,SundayBusiness,"The chip and PIN will prevent anyone from being able to pull this scam, because under that system, the card owner is held liable for the transaction, which no longer can be put off on you or the bank."
983,SundayBusiness,Anything less than $50 doesn't require a signature at any store I've ever shopped.
984,SundayBusiness,That also means your millennial daughter does not know her American history.
985,SundayBusiness,"I think having your signature on the back of a your credit card is incredibly useful. When your card is stolen, it gives the thief a chance to practice your signature."
986,SundayBusiness,"Michele -- we can't get PINS for our US Chip cards.  They're Chip and Signature.  I've tried for years to get 'chip and pin', so they'll be useful in Europe (and Quebec).  Alas, I use the chip, and am still presented with a slip for the signature.  No matter how good my French is, I'm pegged as a tourist.... *sigh*"

He was ready to pull all US forces from Syria about a month ago.<br/><br/>IMHO, this is nothing but a distraction from Mueller, his problems with crooked lawyer Cohen, Stormy Daniels and Avenatti getting closer to exposing him and his crooked cabinetâs swamp antics.<br/><br/>Trump took 6 days before he did anything -the attack was just window dressing and he gave Assad and the Russians plenty of time to minimize the damages.  He might even have used Jared Kushnerâs back channel to warn Putin who is blackmailing him.<br/><br/>Just imagine this clownish former serial draft dodger as POTUS if we had a true military crisis.  How much longer will we have to tolerate this  scammer who is trashing our nation?"
996,Washington,"I knew, as soon as John Bolton got a job with Trump, that a major military action would rapidly ensue. Iâd feel much better about this if Trump wasnât already fired up about domestic quandaries and Bolton, the Ã¼ber hawk, wasnât screeching in his ear.  Not that I donât think Syria or Russia can act with impunity, but a rush to war seems impertinent in the face of Doumaâs tragedy which can hardly leave any victims more dead than the hundreds of thousands slain before them.  <br/><br/>Russiaâs bluff has been called: any retaliation on its part will be a dangerous gambit.  The UK has had its fill of humiliating chemical attacks on its own soil likely perpetrated by Russians.  France is keen to raise its international profile. The US, however, has a moron in charge for whom the political bell tolls. George W. Bush, another Republican disaster, touted himself as a âwar presidentâ to decoy the masses, and, a pound to a sixpence, Trump attempts the same."

998,Washington,"Yeah, weakening Syria's defense allowing more opportunities for those ISIS and Syrian Rebels to go deeper inside Syria. The Civil War was on it's tail as Assad is almost over with retaking Syrian territories from the rebels and the ISIS. And until today, there are no concrete evidence whether or not Assad was behind such 'chemical attacks' and no visible investigations were initiated. US is just ""suspecting."" With this, if ever the rebels are behind those chemical attacks, I bet they would do the same thing again until they get the chance to penetrate Damascus. Trump is a madman. US congress is silent about this. The UN Security Council is all about politics. They were never united with their decisions. <br/><br/>And oh, not to mention future retaliations that might happen in the future. The situation is getting worse day by day. "
999,Washington,"A good move.  First, Trump has the support of key allies.  Second, it was a highly targeted attack.  Trump's maintained a balanced public position toward Russia and Iran, while drawing a red line and enforcing it.<br/><br/>Good job, Mr. President."
1000,Arts&Leisure,A lovely reminiscence from the golden age of culture in New York...  which I was born a year too late (and three thousand miles too far away) to see but have always enjoyed vicariously.
1001,Arts&Leisure,The Shubert Theater in 1930.? Try 1958; that troubled production is legendary.
1002,Arts&Leisure,"I should have mentioned in my earlier post about Noel Coward's story ""Star Quality"" that Coward and Harrison were long time friends and professional colleagues.  Coward once described Harrison as ""the second-best high comedian in the country.""  Needless to say Coward saw himself as number one."
1003,Arts&Leisure,"1956 As Hermione Gingold said once ""I remember it well"" -Not only did I see<br/>MY FAIR LADY once but three times - and I saw it with MY fair lady -gosh<br/>40 years ago -as the Playgoer Magazine announced on its cover BUT - no<br/>it was  62 years ago !!!<br/>I'm 83  and my ex-girlfriend is 80 -MY -how time flies!<br/>I attended 29 Broadway show in one year with her I let her get away from me- You don't forget your first love especially five years of bliss- Happy<br/>to report she is married now 54 year and has three ""children""<br/>She loved Julie Andrews as I did -and got a kick out of Rex Harrison's<br/>convincing ""speaking voice"" -Why Can't The English ? and I have Grown<br/>Accustomed to Her Face -WOW and  The  wonderful music, the score, the scenes - JUST SPECTACULAR - and the Stanley Holloway's ""Get me to the Church On Time""  rang a bell -resoundingly - BEST MUSICAL EVER @<br/>TBA"
1004,Arts&Leisure,"""My Fair Lady"" is a motif that runs through my life.  In 1956 at the age of seven, my parents took me to New York to see the show, and it was thus the first live stage production I ever saw.  At 14, it was the first stage production I ever worked on, playing the French horn in the orchestra for a production at my high school.  At 25, I had become a young production executive at United Artists in Los Angeles, and my new doctor was Herb Tanney.  One day at the end of an appointment, he said he wanted me to come into his office because there was someone he wanted me to meet.  It was another patient of his, Julie Andrews.  I gushed to her that she was the reason I had chosen the entertainment business as my vocation.  Of course she wanted to know why.  But when I told her I'd seen her in the original production of ""My Fair Lady"" when I was seven, she was not amused.  It was my first encounter with a movie star's ego - oops.  Several years later, I was fortunate to befriend George Cukor, who directed the âMy Fair Lady"" film.  I too was disappointed that Julie Andrew hadn't been cast.  It turns out that George was also disappointed, but Jack Warner felt they needed a box office name to help insure the studio's investment.  Of course, the irony is that she was then free to make ""Mary Poppins"" at Disney, and it was the dailies from that film that persuaded Robert Wise to cast her for ""The Sound of Music.""  How do I know this? Bob Wise was my mentor."
1005,Arts&Leisure,i WAS IN MY FAIR LADY WHEN IN HIGH SCHOOL IN THE 1960S. I CAN STILL REMEMBER MOST OF THE LINES AND LYRICS. A REAL CLASSIC.
1006,Arts&Leisure,"Beautiful, elegant, loverly article most worthy of the Musical Classic. Captures  miraculously that opening night pre-run. Does it sound like I was there when the sofa collapsed and Julie Andrews stole the show? Let me leave you guessing."
1007,Arts&Leisure,"A fine article, and how wonderful an irony (for we amateur actors, especially) that Mr. Harrison barely believed he could perform the role, when now it is very difficult for me to suspend disbelief for anyone else as Henry Higgins. I wonder if Robert Preston ever felt that way about Harold Hill? "
1008,Arts&Leisure,"A friend and fellow teenager in New Haven was at that first performance.  To him it was excruciatingly boring and looong, going on that night for a good four hours.  We always assumed it must have been fiercely worked over before it became the biggest thing on Broadway.  My own most thrilling experience at the Shubert was watching Abe Burrows walking up and down outside the theatre, stammering and stuttering and arguing with his fellow showmakers.  Just like in the movies. I don't remember the name of the play.<br/>By the way, one of  the two movie theatres across from the Shubert  was Loew's College.  Loew's Poli was, I believe, on Temple Street.  "
1009,Arts&Leisure,"I well remember, as a youth growing up in a New Haven suburb, listening to this iconic, backstage theater story from my father, who with my mother often attended Shubert performances. As part of the story, Dad recounted that a friend would go on to see other performances by the cast, including in New York, and it was his opinion that Rex Harrison was never better than on that harrowing opening night in New Haven. <br/><br/>Thank you for a wonderful, affirming piece of personal triumph, and for resurrecting some warm family memories from a time long ago."
1010,Arts&Leisure,"Julie Andrews has two firsts in my life:  Mary Poppins was the first movie I saw in a movie theater (it was all drive-ins until then); and in The Sound of Music she was my first crushâI was 9 years old and thought she was the most beautiful thing I had ever seen in my life, and she could SING!  It was glorious.  I'm not quite sure why it took me that extra year to grok her fabulousness...maybe I was too entranced by the movie theater aspect the first time out, or maybe that extra year was what did it.  At this point in my life, my favorite movie of hers is Victor/Victoria.  It's wonderful, exuberant and very funny, and she really struts her range."
1011,Arts&Leisure,This article was wonderful and convinces me the rumors about Rex were true.  He was a rotter.
1012,Arts&Leisure,"The Lincoln Center Theatre's revival of ""My Fair Lady"" is opening this coming Thursday, April 19th.  This is in conjunction with that - the past and the present.  "
1013,Arts&Leisure,"I came out of New Haven in 1954, so there's that..."
1014,Arts&Leisure,"Wow, great comment. "
1015,Arts&Leisure,"Too bad they couldn't have made two version of the movie.  I really love Hepburn even if she didn't do her own singing.  She was sweetness itself.<br/>Andrews has proved herself a big star over the years but would have missed ""My Favorite Things"" if she had been singing ""I Could Have Danced All Night""."
1016,Arts&Leisure,C'mon... remember that bit about walkin' a mile in a man's shoes first.
1017,Arts&Leisure,"I was born in '51 and the best thing that my mother ever did for me was sign me up at about nine for the Capitol Records record-of-the-month.  I collected, memorized and sang - endlessly - all of great musicals, South Pacific, My Fair Lady, Music Man, Bye Bye Birdie, Sound of Music, Gypsy....so many.  :)"
1018,Investigative,"Is this then what Mr. Cohen does for living? Paying out money to women who had sexual relationships with rich men, who - because married or influential or both - were not supposed to have such relationships but could not resist, in order to keep them quiet? Mr. Cohen seems to be acutely lacking in self esteem otherwise, as a lawyer he could have had a (relatively) decent job. "
1019,Investigative,"For over 1.5 million, I promise to stop maligning Trump. Just slip that into the budget where it will go unnoticed. I mean, who is going to care if the deficit goes from 1 trillion to 1 trillion a million and a half? "
1020,Investigative,"What we have here is a cadre of 'old' white, rich men, peppered with a few blacks and a pinch of women; who are morally corrupt, greedy, define and live their lives by hypocrisy. They commit adultery, pay for sex - we know why as Broidy is incredibly ugly - get women pregnant, pay for abortions, lie to their families, condemn Democrats daily for not being conservatives and patriots of our country...it goes on and on. Greed and Power corrupt and we are living this social experiment today through the lens of the Republican Party."
1021,Investigative,"So this is Rome before the Fall, right?"
1022,Investigative,"""He lamented that the issue had become a national news story, which he attributed to the publicity surrounding the federal investigation of Mr. Cohen.""<br/><br/>Translation: It's very unfortunate that I, married with children, prominent Trump supporter and GOP fundraiser, have to step down from my RNC job, just because Trump's personal lawyer paid $1,600,000 to a Playboy Playmate I impregnated."
1023,Investigative,"Not everyone has the moral capacity (i.e. lack thereof) possessed by Michael Cohen to do this kind of work. I have no doubt he sleeps soundly at night and is laughing all the way to the bank, but I'd like to think I would have a problem doing so. I guess that's why he moves in the circles of the rich and powerful and schlubs like me do not. Teach your children what matters. "
1024,Investigative,"Does anyone really think that those highly unusual search warrants were executed to examine the NDA business?  The tactic was to exploit the evidence of that behavior in the name of shaking loose evidence on the original matter, namely the extent of contacts with agents of Russia.  Despite the headlines, it is not clear that the materials seized have been thoroughly examined and compared to other materials that the Special Counsel has.  Lots more to come.<br/><br/>Two questions will come suddenly to the fore: where is Michael Pence and where is a bible?"
1025,Investigative,"It seems to me the legal representation for these women did not act in their clients best interest and all of them are in serious need of sound legal representation to recover damages. <br/><br/>My recommendation is, going forward, they sell an option for the rights to publish their story within a given period of time.<br/><br/>If the story is not published within that time frame the rights revert back to them and they then can sell the option to publish, again, to the highest bidder.<br/><br/>Sounds as if their may be an argument that there was collusion between the legal teams to minimize damage (Trump, et al.) and receive a quick painless payday (the women's attorneys)."
1026,Investigative,Steve Wynn was the Chairman. Michael Cohen and this Gentleman was deputy chairmen. The Party of Moral value!
1027,Investigative,I know too many people that vote Republican and voted for Trump purely on one issue - their pro-life stance against abortion. <br/><br/>I hope the hypocrisy of that sinks in with them some day. <br/><br/>Or is abortion somehow ok as long as you are rich and white and in power?
1028,Investigative,It's the model who should be ashamed of herself.  She holds the blame for frolicking with a married man.  
1029,Investigative,Another outstanding REPCON!

1037,Investigative,"The investigation was: Russian collusion and the 2016 elections.<br/>Anything that occurred prior and not directly connected to the elections is out !!<br/>The fact that the investigation is taking far too long and is currently widening to<br/>encompass irrelevant incidents (as mentioned in this article), is proof that there is no Russian collusion !!!!<br/>Another investigation should be conducted into Hillary's email violation, and into<br/>those people who were involved in helping with this deception, (i.e., Comey/Lynch/Storkh/FBI/including the leakers). "
1038,Investigative,@GOP<br/>Party before family values<br/>Party before decency<br/>Party before morality<br/>Party before Justice and truth<br/>Party before Country
1039,Investigative,"How those members of the Republican Party which is the party of Law and Order, the Party supported by those Christian man with high moral standard, the party against abortion in the name of the sanctity of life, the family value party can be so sinful?"
1040,Investigative,"I'm sure this will be labeled fake news to the base. But, no one could make this stuff up!!!! Republicans are sure to be looking at rough 2018 and maybe 2020! <br/><br/>I'm sure Democrats have some swampy people too. Anthony Weiner comes to mind. But, it seems that the more wealthy the person the lower they sink. "
1041,Investigative,"Family Values? No, no, we said ""Faulty Values."" "
1042,Investigative,This guy Broidy is buying favors all over our Federal Government. I am sure the US voters cannot be proud of the corrupt way that our country conducts its business.
1043,Investigative,"It's an odd way to make more Republicans, but I suppose the 1.6 million is a good start."
1044,Investigative,When you work with Republican politicians you meet the nicest people.
1045,Investigative,"I personally dislike deals to remain quiet about relationships when there is a child involved. That's reprehensible to me.  I don't know if that is the case here as it does not state whether the baby was brought to term.  Where there is no child involved, what is the problem? The woman is taking money to be quiet and he's spending money to keep secret whatever he doesn't want revealed. If there is a child, it sure doesn't seem as if anyone is concerned. If the payor or payee is married, then there is that aspect of it, but frankly, people nowadays run for and win the presidency with that on their resume.  It sounds like this Playboy model (why don't we know her name? Is she a child?) really took Broidy for a lot. But, people and businesses agree to confidentiality agreements all the time about a whole host of things, and usually it is about payments made to settle a case they'd rather the world not know about. They aren't illegal unless there is coercion involved. But, whether I or you find it distasteful or not, I don't understand why anyone should resign over it and if this is a sort of fringe metoo movement thing, I don't get it. It isn't about sexual harassment or assault. To me, taking the money sounds a lot worse morally than paying the money.  No one is forcing them to take the money, are they?  Perhaps closer to the opposite. It's not blackmail (or may not be), but it is heading along that line. "
1046,Investigative,"As treasurer of the RNC,  it stands to reason that Mr. Broidy is part of the brain trust that is orchestrating a slime campaign against James Comey.   Trump and his accomplices are the gift that keeps on giving!  "
1047,Investigative,"Finally, the GOP is starting to drain the swamp.  Of course, it is the swamp, but why quibble.  "
1048,Investigative,The swamp is actively spewing some bad bubbles this week. 
1049,Investigative,"The religious crowd is fine with this stuff when their guys do it. It's religious tribalism that has nothing to do with God, and everything to do with controlling the flock."
1050,Investigative,"The limit is that as long as the crook belongs to the GOP, they'll always understand and forgive.   "
1051,Investigative,"Another aspect to NDA which has been observed in Canada is the suppression of scientific data. People have alleged that industrial installations or activities have caused health problems. This leads to an out of court settlement which includes an NDA. This allows the industry to make the claim ""There is no scientific evidence that this activity causes harm""."
1052,Investigative,"A big problem.  Fortunately, one of the Russians Cohen was meeting with is now sanctioned."
1053,Investigative,"Obama served 2 terms as the U.S. President with dignity, grace, intelligence, and honor. But the Republicans hated him and his wife from the get go. They vowed on Inauguration night in 2009 to never cooperate with him and also to deny him any victories.<br/>    Now Obama is enjoying his life with his wonderful family, away from all of the hateful Republicans. Good for him. He deserves peace and enjoyment in this stage of his accomplished life. "
1054,Investigative,Of course not. Trump has been corrupt for decades.

1061,Investigative,"well, Ryan's budget plan was criminal, too."
1062,Investigative,It's not new.  It's just newly public knowledge.
1063,Investigative,Let's not forget Democrats who are in this category.  I'm sure there are some.
1064,Investigative,"Yes, especially since the pregnancy was terminated."
1065,Metro,I guess  that unions bosses love power and access more than the well being of the people they represent.I remember that some of them endorsed Pataki over Democrat Carl McCall during a previous election. What did the bosses receive for that betrayal? 
1066,Metro,"This is the most sound comment I've read. Lets not forget that Cuomo is very good at lip service. He tried to cram through fracking for two years. Only because the citizens mobilized in large numbers, did he order an environmental impact study. And while doing that impact study, he still tried to push it through. The people are who blocked it.  He is also responsible for the ballot measure that sold off public land to build a casino."
1067,Upshot,"I am interested in understanding for those that oppose Obamacare which of the following two factors is more important in your thinking: (i) the cost or (ii) even if there were little or no cost, it provides a benefit beyond the scope of what should be a limited government?"
1068,Upshot,"1.  Buyers whose income levels qualify them for ACA subsidies are largely indifferent to cost increases.  2. Buyers whose income levels are too high for the subsidies are to a great degree no longer buying ACA compliant coverage ( unless they have high medical costs).  3.  People who are no longer buying coverage obviously cannot stop buying coverage, and thus cannot increase  costs to those who are buying. The alternative to having non-compliant coverage available is simply a higher level of uninsured."
1069,Upshot,"I am hoping and praying things work our for you, LJ and the millions of others in your circumstance. Am a few years ahead of you (3 years to go until Medicare) and could retire now but for the fear of the individual market collapsing before then. I am very lucky to have good insurance at my work, so can't complain that I have to work a few extra years. It is a cruel and ridiculous and totally unnecessary situation that the GOP has created for you and all of us. "
1070,Upshot,"YES, it is failing because CLAIMS are so much higher now than before......if somebody other than Trump were in charge, it would still be falling apart. If it was profitable, the companies would be selling as much as they could handle. Those are FACTS from the industry, NOT cable news.<br/>So what do you think we should do now???"
1071,Foreign,"Likely the problem is just me, likely I do not understand, but American hostility towards Russia strikes me as unproductive but increasingly dangerous.  To me the problem is that we are not using diplomacy and the United Nations in trying to resolve conflicts.  Name-calling and shows of military force and sanctions frighten me, but to what actual avail?"
1072,Foreign,"People fail to understand the basic belief of religious outfits in India like RSS, VHP, Bajrang Dal who make up most of the BJP.  Their thinking is plain and simple - India has to be divided on religious lines and to marginalize minority religions and the only way to do is create a rift between Hindus, Muslims and Christians and to create rift engineer riots.<br/><br/>Modi comes from the same background.  All his tall talk is hollow.  He bowed down at the steps of the Parliament and talks about the constitution.  For him it is just a talk, for him and his cohorts constitution is ""prostitution"".  Unfortunately, the opposition is very weak, any meaningful opposition can be provided by the Congress Party which does not want to give up the dynastic hold of mother-son duo who have low brain power and the rest of the party members do not oppose the dynastic rule.  So they are helping BJP which is racist, bigoted."
1073,Foreign,"I am horrified and deeply saddened that a young girl suffered such extreme trauma and sexual violence, but I am incensed that the calls for justice are aimed at the accused and not for the victim. The BJP has fueled Hindu extremists, and India is an increasingly dangerous place for religious minorities. The ""ringleader"" was also the custodian of the temple where the heinous crime took place (as corroborated by DNA evidence apparently), and according to other reports, those supporting the accused shouted the name of a Hindu deity during a protest.  Vicious crimes in the name of God, or religion or faith, while a family has to live knowing what atrocities were committed against their little girl. I hope that evidence, not religious fervor, dictates the eventual determination by the local court, but my hope for actual justice is dim. "
1074,Dining,"It is somewhat striking to see an Israeli restaurant in New York under a Yiddish name. May I be forgiven by the cognoscenti, if I find the Israeli cuisine uninspiring to the Occidental palates. The reason why, is the theocratic regime of the religious rules, to which the restaurants in the Judaic part of the Holy Land are subjected. All observing the prohibitions of certain foodstuffs by any religion may bear in mind that they are a superstructure erected later by the theologians and clergy on the straightforward and simple Ten Commandments.<br/>Bon appÃ©tit to all of all the allegedly forbidden foods."

He was raised on Social Security Death Benefits after his fathers death and paid his Ohio College tuition with Social Security money and has never held a real job. Last year the Debt was $42.21 TRILLION or 105.4% GPD, and will be a lot more by the time he's out thanks to w. and republicans history of raising the Deficit, starting wars and giving huge tax breaks to the rich when they were paying less than 10% before the tax cuts.  When he took office under President Clinton there was a Surplus of $1.9 Billion but he is bragging that his top priority was keeping the debt down on the backs of the poor and middle class. When will republicans look at the facts instead of listening to the lying. "
1078,Washington,"I will restrain my glee for a while until I see where he surfaces.  It's often much more effective to be on the outside.  <br/><br/>Meanwhile, thanks, Paul for your miserly and cynical service. "
1079,Washington,"Of course.  He pushed through an unpopular tax bill as a gift to the rich and saddled the next generation with the $1.5 trillion debt.  The man is an opportunist, not a leader.  Good riddance."
1080,Washington,Good riddance to the Vichy arm of the GOP
1081,Washington,"Prediction:<br/>1) the Democrats take the House and the Senate in the midterms,<br/>2) Trump is impeached and removed from office,<br/>3) Pence becomes president,<br/>4) President Pence has miserable polling numbers,<br/>5) Ryan runs for president in 2020. "

1084,Washington,"Being the optimistic type, I hope Mr. Ryan will now oppose a Trump Saturday Night Massacre."

1086,Washington,You can only stand up for so long without a spine...
1087,Washington,Another person with contempt against the '1%'.  Please understand the 1% is only a line of earnings people move into and out of the 1%.  The tax cuts do not just benefit people above that line they impact all of America.  These are simple facts not sure why so many get it wrong constantly.
1088,Politics,"""The second- and-third-ranking House Republicans, Kevin McCarthy of California and Steve Scalise of Louisiana, are competing to succeed Mr. Ryan.""<br/><br/>Surely CA will dump all of their 14 House Republicans including McCarthy as the Blue wave washes away the Trump-GOP stain on America.

1092,Politics,"He gets to keep all of those ""campaign contributions"" he got after passing the tax bill.  So along with a big slug of cash and a ton of contacts he will make out like a bandit.  In the end, all he did was line the pockets of the wealthy and powerful by adding to the federal debt that Republicans moaned an groaned about.  Hope he does a better job as a dad than he did as a ""public servant."""
1093,Politics,It's time for Ryan and other Republicans to get out of public life and start cashin$ in on this gravy tax cut they passed for themselves.  Imagine how much Paul can sock away before the newDemocratic majority can start fixing things.
1094,Politics,"It may be wishful thinking, but it appears that Mr Ryan's decision not to run combined with the number of House Republican incumbents who are also retiring is a strong indication that the rats are abandoning the ship.  During the televised vice presidential debate between Mr. Ryan and Mr. Biden prior to the 2012 election, I was left with a visceral dislike for Mr. Ryan who clearly had mastered the art of lying about the putative benefits of his radical economic plans while maintaining a smarmy attitude and a wry smile. In subsequent years, he continued to periodically issue economic plans that also were wildly unrealistic culminating in his key role in authoring the major provisions of the unfair and misleading Trump tax ""cut"".  I am very pleased that Mr. Ryan is retiring from government, but I doubt that his Republican successor will bring about the much needed compromise and cooperation that are required to move America forward."
1095,Politics,So now the Republicans will make Paul Ryan the fall guy for the Hugh losses that they will hopefully experience in November.<br/><br/>Trump can give him the moniker Paul the PiÃ±ata!
1096,Politics,"Be shocked when Reds ""win"" the midterms by 1/2 % despite all the pundits' predictions. Like when Trump ""beat"" Clinton and Bush ""beat"" Gore. The election system is hopelessly rigged by Reds. ""Winning"" by a larger margin would make the sham too obvious."
1097,Politics,"Run away Paul, run away and hide. Instead of manning up, just run away. As an elected official in 2011-2012 he spent the year running for VP. How much did he get done then? He didn't lead, he is just another party leach. Perfect example of what needs to be drained from the swamp. Now he sets the stage for a vacuum to further breakup the Republican party. Way to go. Maybe someone should check his finances and see how much he prospered. Hey Paul, teenage kids don't want their parents around. The kids need their parents in their pre-teen years."
1098,Politics,Of course it hurts fundraising. What's the sense of trying to bribe someone who won't be in power?
1099,Politics,"Paul Krugman nailed Ryan back in 2011 as a flimflam man.  All asterisks and no beef.<br/><br/><a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/06/opinion/06krugman.html"" title=""https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/06/opinion/06krugman.html"" target=""_blank"">https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/06/opinion/06krugman.html</a><br/><br/>In a way, however, we should be grateful that Ryan was just an arrested development Ayn Rand groupie.  Consider the damage he could have done if he had been able to combine his political juvenility with competence -- the way Mitch McConnell does."
1100,Politics,"Speaker Ryan was a victim of  'Trumpadosis'.<br/> Trump so dominated the   political dialog that any one wanting to discuss ideas was drowned out.<br/> Speaker Ryan was between a rock and hard place. He could not find a forum for his financial  ideas and had to compromise his principles in order to pass the spending bill.  He brand of conservative ideas was lost in a sea of conflicting loyalties in the House. He could not  influence the House or the President.  So for him, it was time to quit and move on."
1101,Politics,"I feel like Ryan may come back in a few years. He's getting out now because he senses what's coming. He will have to go against a sitting Republican President or his career will be forever ruined. Trump is headed for big trouble. Maybe impeachment hearings, Esp if he fires Mueller. So Ryan is getting out while the getting is good. It's ironic in a way. because if Trump is impeached or has to step down. Pence may have to go too. He lied about the Russian thing also, and who knows what else he may have in the closet. In which case Ryan would have become President.... Yes I don't think we've heard the last of Paul Ryan. "
1102,Politics,"The Republican party may ""splinter"" â but what's left is going to make the Tea Party look like a bunch of liberals."
1103,Politics,Does this move allow Ryan to commence impeachment hearings as the Mueller investigation unfolds?
1104,Politics,Fleas leaving a sinking RAT.
1105,Politics,Is the Democratic strategy just to sit back and hope Republicans don't run any candidates? Sure seems like it. Another round of voting against someone instead of voting for someone. 
1106,Politics,The surest sign yet that the ship is sinking.
1107,Politics,He doesn't want to be there when his deficits hit the fan and our debt goes through the roof.
1108,Politics,"Since when Ryan the ""working man's friend""?  He worked hard to take down Medicare and SS.  He succeeded in passing a tax cut for the top 10% with a sop to the remaining taxpayers which will sunset in 2027.  Then the ""working"" taxpayers will have a huge revenue loss to pay for with increased taxes.  Ryan is one of the worst Congressmen to have the Speakership in my lifetime.  He is a liar about everything; a mediocre intellect who was touted as a policy ""wonk"".  He even lied about his marathon time.  Good riddance, indeed."
1109,Politics,he is very content being rich and being called a coward does not insult him.
1110,Politics,don't hold your breath.
1111,Politics,"This is actually the only logical answer I have heard to the question, âWhy have so many otherwise-at-least-semi-sane people with whom I happen to disagree sat idly by, doing nothing to stop Trump?â Or, if numerous Congresspeople are not in debt to Russian oligarchs, then they at least owe something big to someone, somewhere, which person has a vested interest in lower corporate and estate taxes, as well as the national and international diminishment of the United States. <br/><br/>I suppose fear and confusion, laziness and a near-religious zeal for towing the party line, also contribute to Congressional complacency. Or, possibly, they are driven by actual religious fervor, legislator-whispering to them, urging them to abandon all of humankindâs legal principles in order to uphold what they see as âHigher Principlesâ in the form of stacked courts and the implementation of their own glorious brand of cultural conservatism.<br/><br/>The reason for their (in)action is worthy of serious study, but studies and analysis can wait until weâve voted them out of office."
1112,Washington,"The ACCESS HOLLYWOOD tape gets released.<br/><br/>The Trump team meets to discuss damage control/distraction.

Otherwise, it is just bullying and abuse of power, something the USA has tended to do for, oh, 50 some years or so."
1121,Foreign,Using chemical weapons isnât the only kind of war crime. Thereâs also the invading and occupying without actual evidence of threat kind. Or firing missiles at weddings kind. Or drone attacking civilians far from the battlefield kind. Or using helicopter gunships to destroy hospitals kind. <br/><br/>Youâd think countries that exhibited a pattern of the latter would be be more self conscious about accusing others of the former. Or at least demonstrate some level of contriteness by rounding up the perpetrators and shipping them to The Hague in orange jumpsuits.

1147,OpEd,"I also live in a district (Texas 7th) that is rated a toss-up.  This part of Houston is a district shaped like a boot due to gerrymandering, which includes many suburban educated voters.  This district also voted for Hillary Clinton by just over 1 percent and is a prime example of an area where suburban women don't like Trump.<br/><br/>We will have one of two candidates (either Lizzie Fletcher or Laura Moser--run-off is in May) against incumbent Republican John Culberson whose claim to fame is birther legislation and who hasn't been around to give a town hall in months (the last one made national news with lots of angry voters).<br/><br/>For the first time ever, I have volunteered for one of the Democratic candidates and have made donations as Culberson is not representing the Clinton voters of this district.   He instead has supported Trump non-stop.<br/><br/>Interestingly, I am seeing very few yard signs around what is normally a safe Republican area.  I think that means that people are voting for the Democrats but they don't want their neighbors to know.  It was the same in 2016 as voters quietly selected Clinton."

After 30 years in and around the Apple, why do I want to be subjected to more? The area needs economic development, yes. Not hubris houses &amp; restaurants named ""Loom."""

Iâm so happy wealthy folk are redeveloping blighted areas of north county and taking advantage of for now low prices. But the reality is the Berkshires are very rich poor. The service and tourism jobs do not pay enough to raise a family and buy a house now at inflated prices. Pittsfield only 40 years ago had literally thousands of well paying GE jobs. They are all gone. Finally since all decisions are made in Boston the state capital, the infrastructure of the Berkshires is crumbling.

1167,Metropolitan,"Sam Roberts, now so famous, reported the dorm fire covered again here. I believe he was a senior writing for The Cornell Daily Sun - Extra Edition on Wednesday April 5, 1967, day of the fire. Among other things, Sam writes obituaries for The Times today. "
1168,Metropolitan,"Do you realize how confusing (and how did this get past the editors) this crucial snippet is? ""But his wife"" literally means the wife of the possible arsonist:<br/><br/>One of them recalled the student. âBut his wife really remembered him,â Mr. Fogle said. âShe knew he had changed his name and visited his family in Brooklyn. And she remembered the new name.â"
1169,Metropolitan,"Not only did I find the article interesting, I find the comments fascinating - ranging from people who thought it an excellent article to those who thought it was a waste of their time. It is not a âwhodunnitâ - for that, you can watch the latest Masterpiece Series âUnforgottenâ (which, BTW, has excellent justification made by DCI Stewart for pursuing cold cases). The article also depicts a type of student, many who apparently did achieve goals (whether in academia or other fields), but who most likely would have done that without a special program singling them out, and some of whom clearly needed better supervision. So it can add to our reflections of how gifted students should be educated. It also gave a picture of what, sadly, is all to frequent negligence on the part of organizations - whether schools, government, or corporations. If one school or apartment building owner considers whether they really meet the fire safety regulations and if not acts on it, then the article has been valuable. "
1170,Metropolitan,"I entered Cornell in Sept '67 &amp; soon thereafter became closely connected with several of the Res Club survivors, some of whom are mentioned/quoted in this article. From what I recall, the article is factually correct; moreover, it well evokes the trauma, confusion, &amp; administration callousness of the fires' aftermath(s). The investigation was still active when I arrived in Ithaca, &amp; while any murder/arson investigation is going to tread on sensitivities, this one appeared to be vicious, especially towards an individual whom authorities apparently had decided was the villain. This person later was cleared, although you wouldn't have known that from the words of Cornell's administrators (nor the police). I appreciate the thorough research &amp; excellent writing here, even if it has led to nightmares. "
1171,Metropolitan,"Posted for Judy Hellman:<br/>Having escaped the res club fire, I share with the other survivors a sense that only Bill Fogleâs doggedness (correctly characterized by Sonny Kleinfield as âobsessiveâ), could have brought us all together, since it was Fogle who managed to locate more than 40 of us and put us in contact.<br/><br/> When we survivors learned that Kleinfield was willing to take on this case, we were confident that the story would be told in an exceedingly well documented and compelling way. Among us there may be unhappiness with some choices that Kleinfield made with regard to the emphasis he gave to Fogle and the flaws in the PhD program.  But thanks to him the story is out there and now all can see that Cornell was unwilling to assume responsibility, provide a clear reckoning of the events much less acknowledge any failings that could bring charges of criminal negligence: i.e. that it housed 60+ students and faculty in a  building with no functioning fire doors, no fire alarm system, no sprinklers, no fire escapes, no alternative exits to the door in the lobby and no fire drills.<br/><br/>The the case against Cornell is its stony silence, if, indeed, it is not guilty of covering-up criminal negligence with respect to fire prevention, along with its responsibility for sending forth into society â with neither punishment nor treatment-- someone capable of deliberate, homicidal acts.<br/><br/>May other Cornellians take note that our alma mater has never apologized nor memorialized the Nine."
1172,Metropolitan,"Would be nice to see Cornell create a more thoughtful memorial/tribute simply because it is the noble and right thing for a caring university community to do, and not merely because alumni were interested in it. "
1173,Metropolitan,I was willing to be supportive of Fogle's efforts until I read his comment that liberals were worse than terrorists. This is not a person who reasons soundly.
1174,Metropolitan,âWho can remember such a long time ago?â<br/><br/>What a terrible epitaph.   
1175,Metropolitan,"What struck me, is his comment about 'Liberals being worse than terrorists'. Arizona is filled with guys like him, we call them ""Backeastos"", they move west, bringing their 'better' ways with them, the very ways they ran from. They pollute our native politics with  their outsider attitudes, rather than attempt to blend in to their new culture.  These are the Joe Arpio types, never fitting in the West, so they force their will on the locals. I tell them all, ""Go back where you can from""."
1176,Metropolitan,"It's articles like these that keep me subscribing to the NY Times.  Well written, unbiased, and complete as time and facts will allow...thank you N.R. Kleinfield and thank you NT Times."
1177,Metropolitan,"I was a freshman at Cornell, knew some of those in the program (not, mercifully those killed). I don't know how Jim Perkins is seen today but he was clearly a man with the multiversity dream and got some others to underwrite it to ""streamline"" American education. After 40 years of teaching I know you should not rush it. It flows from the inside. We teachers stand on the outside showing the ways you might think about something. One factual error, I believe, a tree was planted in honor of Professor Finch on the Quad. My father who was in the English department (and probably many others) were behind it. I have a dim memory that the tree did not survive a storm or the winter. I hope I am wrong. As for the source of that commemoration, it certainly came from the English department "
1178,Metropolitan,"As someone who has been a part of hundreds of fire investigations-both accidental and arson-Iâm troubled by this passage in the article-<br/> âThe coroner concluded it was improbable that the fire had a mechanical cause and that it was likely that someone set it. Given that no evidence of arson was found, he couldnât say whether it was an accident or deliberate, carelessness or a heinous crime.â<br/>If someone âlikely setâ the fire, that would be an act of arson, but no evidence of arson was found?  So what evidence was found? Where was the point of origin and what was in that area prior to the fire? Nothing mechanical (or electrical?) apparently, but what indicated (or didnât) an accident or carelessness? What indicated it was âlikely setâ? Even in a destroyed room or building we can usually always find a point of origin and from the two period photographs, one exterior, one interior, Iâm sure a point of origin was found or could have been found.  Was there a cause and origin report that the coroner used to make his puzzling statement? Arson investigation has only recently come into more of a modern forensic science approach and focus. It has only been since 1992 that a standardized guide for fire investigation was published by the National Fire Protection Association-NFPA publication 921-our âBible.â Sorry to say, but this passage, if reported and quoted correctly, indicates to me a questionable investigation. Strange to be banging on somebodyâs door without knowing some facts."
1179,Metropolitan,"This is an intriguing and sad story.  The ending does seem to leave the reader hanging.<br/> The writer composed a compelling and extremely well-written essay. Clearly, he is a very talented journalist, who knows how to weave a readable article."
1180,Metropolitan,I was at Cornell in the 70s and people still talked about this case. I think you have to remember how different things were then. People didn't ask questions and there weren't cellphone cameras everywhere to leave an electronic trail. Professors slept with students and seniors bullied freshmen. I'm not sure Cornell's handling of this was much different from how universities handled everything in those days.  
1181,Metropolitan,"What a riveting article.  I have no connection with the fire but was drawn by the author's storytelling skill.<br/>Isn't history littered with people who doggedly pursue  mysteries even when their likelihood of solution is miniscule?<br/>Some pursuers may be deeply flawed.  Others not so much.<br/>What matters is their result.<br/>If nothing else Mr. Fogle's search says the victims lives had worth.  They should not be forgotten.<br/>Whatever pain he brings to some survivors by stirring memories is, hopefully, more than offset by satisfaction in knowing the search for truth continues.<br/>We do not leave our dead on the battlefield.   Bringing them home shows our respect for their lives and by extension all life.<br/>With his search Mr Fogle is doing the same for these men and women."
1182,Metropolitan,"As someone who lived through a shooting in our dorm, Low Rise 7 in 1983 during finals week. It was not far from the Ecology House. I am only learning about this from this article, despite being a 2nd generation alum, <br/><br/>I am, however, not at all surprised by Cornell's lack of acknowledgement of the tragedy. Their primary concern is the reputation of the institution, not an honest relationship with its students and alumni. The sole response to the shooting which left 2 women dead was to tell us that we could take our finals in January if we needed to do that. <br/><br/>I feel for the survivors of that fire and can relate to their trauma. I've lived with the PTSD from my shooting with no follow-up or support from the university. But when they want to raise money - they know where to find me. Acknowledge that something went wrong on campus? That won't happen. "
1183,Metropolitan,NR Kleinfeld is such a phenomenally talented writer. I canât stop thinking about this story.
1184,Metropolitan,"Outstanding article with meticulous research - facts only, no interpolation of personal opinions by N.R. Kleinfield. Discrete, complete and riveting. I am left with an emptiness that the students are all but forgotten. <br/><br/>Mr. Fogle's disrespectful references, such as brainiacs and his idea that liberals are worse than terrorists dilute the veracity of his work. Nonetheless, reading about the terrible tragedy has touched me deeply; I hope the students' and professor's families and friends have somehow found peace."
1185,Metropolitan,"Exceptionally written, enrapturing.  I fell into my own rabbit hole throughout &amp; an ornery tangent tendril of my conscience kept tapping me on the shoulder &amp; saying what an amazing movie it would make.  High drama, higher egoes, soaring flames and unsolved enigmas."
1186,Metropolitan,"Jennie Sun was a sorority sister of mine in Delta Gamma, Chi Chapter at Cornell.  By those who knew her, she was beloved.  And still mourned."
1187,Metropolitan,"Seeing your story today reminded me of the shock and fear I felt when reading the original Times report of the fire in 1967, knowing that a close friend from high school had just enrolled in the Phud program the previous autumn and was living in that dorm. Luckily, she was not listed among the dead or injured and was even quoted in a second article about the fire that day, so I knew she was alive, even if badly shaken. When I spoke with her weeks afterwards, she described the anxiety of the survivors, the intense questioning by investigators, and the fear that a member of the program had been responsible. Ultimately, she moved on to another school, got her doctorate, and became a successful university professor, but I wonder now what scars may have remained long after the event."
1188,Metropolitan,"1) A certain number of years PhD program, seems wrong.  In this case it was 6 years.  The PhD requires original thought.  If it isn't there, then no PhD degree.    I am surprised that The Ivy League, although it isn't Harvard (considered to be the best), approved of such a program... especially if it involves high achieving Students (as described).<br/><br/>2) There is somewhat of a picture of the repurposed motel.  It doesn't look like the Hyatt, the Ritz Carlton, or even a Hampton Inn.  It looks like a dump... especially considering what happened on the inside.  Was it?  When I went to Duke 83-87 for undergrad, I was disappointed in the living accommodations.  I was a Financial Aid Student.  Like at Harvard, I suspect that at Duke, some Students lived in groups where their Parents paid several thousands of dollars... up to a million (from what I recently heard) for their children to live in a ""membership club"" situation.  If the Parents don't pay then no membership.  Of course I was stuck with what the University offered.  Since the tuition is a lot of money, I expected to have better Student support, as opposed to additional obstacles.  After all, I worked hard to have a Report Card to get into Duke.  I was Valedictorian.  I think these Students at Cornell probably deserved better accommodations.  Cornell spent so much to get them there, and then they live in a dump.  Thoughtless.  Probably the 6 yr PhD program of theirs was not good either... certainly not brilliant.            "
1189,Metropolitan,"I am Cornell class of 74 and am ashamed to say I barely knew about this story. By the time I arrived on campus from the sheltered Midwest the past event of note was the takeover of Willard Straight Hall in 1969 - helped by the fact a Pulitzer Prize winning photo forever immortalized the event. <br/><br/>I was really struck by Cornell's tone deaf handling of the survivors. Looking back at my time there, I realize I was charmed by the setting and the people, including some stellar professors. But the institution itself had many flaws at that time. Cornell did a terrible job of guiding young students. They basically admitted undergrads and then let them fend for themselves with very little guidance. If this elite PhD program was Cornell's premiere program, you can imagine what it was like for everyone else.   "
1190,Metropolitan,"âI find liberals to be more destructive than terrorists,â said Bill Fogle.<br/><br/>Perhaps Mr. Fogle is not the most even-handed investigator."
1191,Metropolitan,"This is an engaging account of what is really a life-long tragedy.  If you stop and look carefully at the faces of the students who perished in the flames and smoke from the flames you will see the unrealized hopes and dreams of their parents and loved ones who were sentenced by that event to carry the burden of grief for the rest of their lives.  One can only hope that the perpetrator - if there was one - is also carrying the burden of his or her wanton act of cruelty as they live the long days and nights of their own lifetime.  We can imagine that like most human beings they, too, will encounter and have to bare the vicissitudes of life and that unlike those of us who suffer without cause the blows of life, they will feel the sharp thorn of reproach for what we might imagine remains of their life long burden of guilt and shame.  I am imagining that the guilty party has read Mr. Kleinfield's article with great care and even now is pouring over the words of these comments and so this comment is really meant for them, not the guiltless and casual others here, but for the twisted mind who with every glance at his own hands knows with absolute certainty that they were the flesh which struck the match.  I wish him or her many many years of life ahead so that with each sad turn of fate in their lives they will writhe and twitch, suspended on their own living gallows.  "
1192,Metropolitan,"First, let's be thankful for not publishing the name of what seems to be the main suspect. The author nevertheless follows the trail and provides a between the line narrative which points the finger.<br/>As the wife declares "" ... the kids do not know about this..."", we have to wonder how many survivors kept that much quiet. Smells guilt.<br/>Where was the ""Sir, one more question?""<br/>Unless seen in TV shows, the criminal mind does not confess."
1193,Metropolitan,Great piece.  Thank you.
1194,Metropolitan,"Dale Corson, the provost  was as honest and diligent as they come.  No way there was a cover up on his watch. "
1195,Metropolitan,"Someone in authority (cold case expert aided by leading FBI arson expert) needs to examine Fogle's work (he is now beyond point of objectivity), press on, and render a final official opinion.<br/><br/>...and from this armchair sleuth: <br/><br/>""there had been three fires across two months, all around the same time in the morning â 4:08, 4:43, 4:51""<br/><br/>was a real hard look ever taken at the 2 other sites for detailed forensic evidence  (i.e. finger prints, accelerants used, Phud alibis (incl prime who said he was there but wasn't)?"
1196,Metropolitan,"In the 80s I knew of the Eco House fire but I guess I should have known, it never occurred to me, that it wasn't yet Eco House in 1967."
1197,Metropolitan,"Let us not forget that Cornell, the first really modern, secular American university (the model for places such as Stanford, Chicago and Johns Hopkins) that prompted reforms at older, stodgier institutions, for well over 100 years under invested in student housing, even as its academic plant grew tremendously.  It was disgraceful that the PHD program and undergraduates were housed in a cheap, failed business structure off campus.  Male students after freshman year could go on a waiting list for the lovely but tiny upperclass dorms or live in fraternities, which were usually overcrowded messes behind impressive facades, or live in firetrap buildings in Collegetown. I was at law school in NYC in 67.<br/>   I was outraged at the fire but not really surprised.  The late James A Perkins was a terribly nice establishmentarian gentleman, ill suited to being chief executive of such a complex university, as events in 1969 would demonstrate.<br/>   I also wonder if N.R. Kleinfeld counter-investigated Mr. Fogel, particularly the DKE house, its reputation at Cornell in the 60s and its connection to the more widely-reported '69 disturbances.<br/>   Cornell needed to be concerned with its reputation as a sink or swim place -- perhaps recently overly concerned, as I have noticed 'safe spaces' marked out in its new, excellent residential buildings.  Clearly there is more of a therapy culture on campus.  "
1198,Metropolitan,"Thanks NYT. Interesting story, good writing. This and other stories like it make the monthly subscription fee a very good investment."
1199,Metropolitan,"Thank you for your well researched article. It is a tragedy that Cornell apparently never owned up to. However, it doesn't seem the mystery will ever be solved. The bottom line is - Cornell should have taken more responsibility for this and, I hope, fire violations are a thing of the past for the school."
1200,Metropolitan,"What a callous statement completely lacking in empathy.  No matter an individualâs faubles, each of these young people went through a horrific experience and, it seems, was left to deal with the subsequent emotional trauma in isolation.  The lack of lawsuits, though a sign of a less litigious society, also illustrate a decided âunwimpinessâ in that students and families did not look for a monetary answer to the painful questions they have lived with for the rest of their lives. "
1201,Metropolitan,"These are the extant qualifications of most of the gifted and/or motivated kids coming out of competitive highs schools to day, minus the swimming. Moving through 5-7 AP courses and accelerated math and language is not unusual for kids in these ambitious tracks, but at ages 14-18  it does seem to add significant stress which has been reported on by the NYTs (especially Frank Bruni). <br/><br/>Today, there are large numbers of students who arrive at college with significant core credit who could finish an undergraduate degree on a truncated schedule, but their AP credit is a part of those 120 hours so they don't have to take unreasonably overloaded schedules to do so. It is also common to see undergraduate/master's degree program combinations designed to finish in about 5 years. But the idea that a PhD of significant original advanced scholarship can be generated on a six year accelerated schedule is ludicrous and the failure of program speaks for itself. <br/><br/>Cornell and Ford could have taken these same bright students and given them a supportive, nurturing system and actually succeeded in their mandate but for the myopic and utilitarian philosophy that underscored the endeavor. We still have this flavors of this problem in education, where students must jump through ever more competitive hoops to have access to educational opportunities that in so many modern nations are FREE or nearly so. The more things change, the more they stay the same. That gives me the shivers."
1202,Metropolitan,Shame on you for dismissing the deaths of these victims!
1203,Metropolitan,"Why is the âsuspectâ the only one apparently who refused a lie detector test? Why did he change his name? Why do all involved want to talk about the fire and process it, except for him? These are just three of his suspicious actions. They donât prove guilt of course but itâs clear he is hiding something. And if he is suspected of being the murderer, itâs because of his own doing. "
1204,Metropolitan,"I know many people who are extremely private. If this happened to them, they would not want to talk with anyone about it in any way, whether to an investigator, a reporter, or classmates.  They would retreat and âhideâ from the situation. So I can understand this manâs reaction. <br/><br/>Changing oneâs name to prevent more intrusion from the horrific event seems to be a PTSD reaction....remember, these students got little counseling after the deaths of their classmates and the loss of their home. This studentâs poor relationship with his parents made his trauma even worse, with no home or support to return to.<br/><br/>Do not judge others to be guilty simply because they do not have the same reactions that you consider best."
1205,Metropolitan,Maybe he didnât take a lie detector test because they arenât foolproofâask any lawyer. Maybe he changed his name because he feared for his safety from those who were (and are) looking for a scapegoat. Maybe he doesnât want to talk about it because he knows how quickly people twist words to suit their own ends. 
1206,Metropolitan,"Please paint those visuals, either on canvas or in words, or both."
1207,Metropolitan,"Your statement about inadequate vetting reinforces what one of the Phuds said about some Students being very prepared, and some were ""interesting"" but not prepared.  ---- Clearly, Admissions needed to go through another Student weed-out round.  -----  Actually, this problem of not tracking Students very well, thus lumping them together as opposed to thoughtful grouping... is a problem throughout University, even The Ivy League.  And, also the K-12 School.  Currently, there are Future plans to move the serious, academic Students into a program called All Academic.  I am involved with this All Academic creation.  There will be a track called:  The Brilliant IQ Track.       "
1208,Metropolitan,You want to have seen a real dump at Duke?  The old Graduate Center--a single student dorm.  I wonder if the building is still there.  I know someone who started grad school there in the mid-70s.  Believe me....
1209,Metropolitan,Tim was quite beloved by the group and is well remembered.
1210,Metropolitan,"I am a Cornell alum from the 1980s and never heard about this.  I had a high school friend that lived in Ecology House which I guess is still a special-interest dorm.  <br/><br/>Yes, Cornell is a very flawed place that would want to hide flaws.   It should have been the land-grant flagship for New York State but instead has this weird state/private hybrid structure.   The new freshman set-up has improved things somewhat.   I guess they don't want to dwell on tragedies but this was a mass death incident that affected many people for a long time.  <br/><br/>I don't understand what a '6 year PhD' is.  Was it intended as a BA/PhD program like those combined BA/MD programs?  "
1211,Metropolitan,"Colleges and universities have gotten much better at recognizing and supporting the needs of students outside the classroom. That takes a lot of funding and staffing, but there are many dedicated staff and administrators who work tirelessly to support students and respond to their crises much better than was common in the 1960s (when students mostly rejected the idea of college involvement in their personal lives) and even through the 1980s and 1990s. Sadly, many academic faculty perceive these efforts as rivals for funding and resources, and constantly berate ""bloated administrations"" for doing the work with students that professors are unwilling, ill-equipped temperamentally, or unable to do.<br/><br/>Campuses are better places for students now, and they should be, given the cost of college these days. "
1212,Metropolitan,"Yes, a statement like that certainly doesn't indicate a close working relationship with factuality."
1213,Metropolitan,Maybe the kids do not know about the new identity???
1214,Metropolitan,But we most definitely did not know about the followup fires at Watermargin etc...
1215,Metropolitan,"Ed, I also remembered that murder but had to look up the details.  It has also drawn some attention from amateur sleuths.  The victim, Jenny Low Chang, was the daughter of Chinese immigrants and a pre-med student. She was found raped and murdered in a locked faculty reading room, to which she did NOT have the key, keys and cards being limited to faculty and library staff. The suspect was a security guard on the night shift with a history of abusing women. He was fired but the case was dropped, apparently for political reasons having to do with not inflaming racial tensions. That removes it from the category of unsolved murders into that of cover-up by both the university and local authorities."
1216,Metropolitan,Agreed!!
1217,Metropolitan,"The same could be said for SSMCIS, an accelerated experimental math program that was tested for about a decade (1965?-75?) in a handful of school districts around the NYC area. Teaneck, NJ was one of the districts. A program of Columbia University Teachers College, it was supposed to take us deeply into college level math by the end of high school. Participants (15-20% of each grade) were selected on the basis of sixth grade standardized test scores. For me it was a unsuccessful; by 9th grade I was taking remedial algebra and working my way out of a slough of despond over my failure as a super-geek. It seemed to work well for maybe half of those who were originally chosen. Test scores are absolutely an imperfect selection method for educational innovation."
1218,Metropolitan,Was that a case of arson? Is this the same property that was part of Jesuit seminary that became Kripalu?  They still called it Shadowbrook. 
1219,Metropolitan,"In my book, the ânumerous other firesâ you cite would be âalarmingâânot just âa bit questionableâ!"

1224,Upshot,"It's pathetic how banks work over the people in America. They continue to prop up their coffers and give back almost nothing. Their stocks go up, their profits go, the bonuses their top executives get go up, all while all they do is try to figure out how to pad their bottom line any way possible. They get caught swindling mainstream America and almost nothing happens. It's ludicrous how little they give back. When the economy crashed and the government stepped in and saved the banks butts they paid back their debts in about a year, it was pretty damn easy for them to come out of their near collapse back into the black.It highlighted just how quickly and much money they really make."
1225,Upshot,"Regarding ""after a decade of low interest rates, many banking customers seem almost to have forgotten that theyâre supposed to get something in exchange for their money"". Just like for privacy, people (especially the young) are trained in the ""new normal"" and come to accept it.  "
1226,Upshot,"I just completed my move from Wells Fargo to Ally Bank. It took almost 3 months to complete (I didn't read all the fine print) but it was worth it.<br/><br/>Yes it's weird to have my money in a bank that has no branches, and no, I'm really not thrilled with the wait times when I call for assistance, but my savings account @ Ally earned more interest in a single month than the same money earned @ Wells Fargo in an entire year.<br/><br/>Don't be stubborn. The math is simple."
1227,Styles,"I wouldn't exactly characterize Stan Lee's life as elder abuse, however, that being said, I would say, based on the reporting and the photos, that anyone who sports the affectation of a bowler hat AND looks and dresses like the Penguin is not to be trusted. "
1228,Styles,"I grew up reading Marvel Comics and Stan Lee's monthly column as editor. Good for him that he lived long enough (unlike Jack Kirby and others) to see the characters he created become global phenomena. To see his legacy and estate being fought over by those whose interest is more financial than anything else is sad and a reminder of what awaits us all. Thank you, Excelsior!"
1229,Styles,"Pablo Picasso was never in the United State, It would have been impossible for him to do the drawing that is spoken about near the end of the piece of Mrs. Lee dinning with her husband at an NYC restaurant.  "
1230,Styles,Great guy!
1231,Styles,Excellent observation.
1232,Styles,"If a man is as lucky as Stan Lee, he's got geniuses working at bargain basement rates to do most of the creating for him, and he just punches up the dialogue a bit, and makes (usually good) suggestions.<br/><br/>He was an editor, much more than he ever was a writer.  His own writing, sans Kirby, Ditko, et al, was never impressive.  But he knew how to sell in a way they didn't.  He deserves his share of the credit, but he sometimes had a tendency to take more than his share, and he was in a position to do so.  And now that he's outlived all his old collaborators, he can tell the story any way he likes.  Sure, Stan, you had the idea of a black superhero.  Not Kirby, who introduced all kinds of minority characters, even a Native American named Wyatt Wingfoot.  You go on and tell that story.  <br/><br/>And so, even if he did get robbed, I'm not shedding any tears for him.  He really was the luckiest guy in the world, or at least in the comic book world.  I admire his youthful spirit, I acknowledge his genuine contributions, but genius?  C'mon.  A very inspired hustler.  And there's something to be said for that."
1233,Styles,What? Stan Lee embellished this story? By the Mystic Moguls of Megador!!!! Impossible! There must have been s cosmic shift in the alternative universe allowing Picasso to remain in France  while astral projecting himself to New York to enjoy a corned beef sandwich at Katz's
1234,Styles,He doesn't need the extra money. He has plenty to live well on. And he is obviously happier than he would have been if he had been obsessed with money.
1235,Styles,"I've heard this too, but when Kirby finally went out on his own and tried to write his own comics, they failed badly. He failed not due to his artwork, obviously, but due to his writing including his dialogue, so the theory that Stan was only supplying 'ideas' (whatever level of detail that implies or doesn't imply) seems to be an inaccurate slant. The dialogue that worked in the Marvel comics credited to Kirby and Lee came from somewhere, but apparently not from Kirby. It may be the case that Stan Lee provided the story arc to Kirby, Kirby drew it and wrote initial dialogue, and Stan later heavily revised that dialogue. That's the only possible explanation (if this system was indeed used at all), in which case Stan was more heavily involved creatively that the new trend of dumping on Stan Lee would have us believe. "
1236,Learning,"Multiple times I've been told, and perhaps some of the whole hasn't, that anything you post on Social Media that's ""your"" privacy, now becomes anyone's privacy. Whenever you sign up for a social media site, or for anything in the world, there is always a contract; a contract that few ever feel the need to read. For Facebook there was a very clear Terms of Service; ""For content that is covered by intellectual property rights, like photos and videos (IP content), you specifically give us the following permission, subject to your privacy and application settings: you grant us a non-exclusive, transferable, sub-licensable, royalty-free, worldwide license to use any IP content that you post..."". <br/><br/>How people share their personal experiences and in-depth details of their life on Social Media, for the whole world to see, not paying attention to the contract, or the simple fact that anyone can see it, befuddles me. Who are you to blame but yourself? The social platform must be to blame, right?"
1237,Culture,"I have a new theory about Darius, which is that he is an angel or boddhisatva, or some other spiritual being on earth.

(People still need to get to work on Friday, so less difficulty may be called for).  I think Friday is probably a good day to showcase these paper tigers -- which give people a sense of accomplishment when the intimidation is stared down.  On the couple occasions when a paper tiger ran on Saturday, some solvers said they wanted a longer lasting challenge.  So, intimidation isn't the main factor."

1243,Weekend,Closing September 2???
1244,Weekend,Isnt it time for a black Nellie Forbush?
1245,Weekend,Be advised to read other reviews if you are on the fence.  Brantley is in the minority with this rave.
1246,Weekend,"I have always loved this show. It was the first musical I did in high school. My parents owned the 1945 album which I played through to the other side. I own the cd of the original cast recording. There is nothing like John Raitt singing âsoliloquy â. I saw the Hytner production in London. I would love to be able to see this revival. While criticism is valid for anything, no offense to all you New Yorkers, but youâre pretty spoiled when you have access to wonderful things like this. Even if it tours, Iâll never get to hear Renee Fleming sing â youâll never walk alone â ............"
1247,Weekend,"At the end of the show in previews, total strangers were turning to one another and saying, âWasnât that amazing?â Joshua Henry alone is worth the ticket price, and then you have Jessie Mueller and Renee Fleming and others, not to mention all the gorgeous dancing. Hope to see it again. "
1248,Weekend,"Did I see the same  production as you, Mr. Brantley? I'm guessing I did not. Carousel in 2018 was dull at best.<br/><br/>The most egregious flaw of this production of Carousel was the utter lack of chemistry between Ms. Mueller and Mr. Henry. I never for one second believed that there was any attraction, any affection, any anything other than that Billy felt trapped and angry while Julie was meekly making excuses. Billy was a bully, and remained that way throughout, even when he had one more chance on Earth.<br/><br/>Wasn't sure what to make of the character of Jigger. Amar Ramasar's dancing was lovely, but his character was pure thug. Nothing redeeming there, either.<br/>(Speaking of dance - on top of such glaring lack of spark in the rest of the play, the dance scenes felt long and drawn out.) And Louise? Just no.<br/><br/>The highlights for me were Lindsay Mendez as Carrie - who infused her part with sass and humor - and RenÃ©e Fleming (of course). But these highlights were too few and far between. <br/><br/>Found this to be sadly disappointing. This is a classic piece of American theater, tamped down in this odd and boring production."
1249,Weekend,"I saw Carousel and left in tears.  Not because it was a perfect production, but because it gave me a glimpse of what American theater used to be: (at least semi) original stories, told through lush scores, with simple, yet profound lyrics, that meditated on real issues.<br/><br/>While there are many ""legit"" musicals of the modern era, the predominant musical mode on Broadway is pop--and now thanks to Hamilton rap.  I have no issue with this as I agree with Bernstein that American musical theater should be in the vernacular (at least in part)--be that jazz, hip-hop or rock.<br/>But Bernstein also spoke of musical theater as American Opera--and in that regard I think we need to invest in musicals that require equal parts vocalism as dramatism.  Real music should not be thrown away; it still has something to say as Sondheim reminds us in everything he does. "
1250,Weekend,"Half terrific??  Come on!<br/>This show - with the amazing cast, the integration of actors and dancers, the incredible song - is not a revival but a rebirth.  If Mr Brantley understood that life gives us way too many chances for bad choices, he would understand that the ""hope"" in the last song is not maudlin, but represents the best we can do.  If he understood that, he would understand why the audience weeped and cheered - both with abandon.<br/>TOTALLY terrific!"
1251,Weekend,"Ben Brantley is just an amazing writer.  Whether someone agrees with his viewpoint on Carosel or not, reading his review is a treat.  I saw the play, and though about what I might say if I were to review it.  I enjoyed the play, but could never have come up with such an elegant review as Mr. Brantley has done.<br/>He is a great asset to the NYT, and readers, I'm sure, recognize this."
1252,Weekend,"Oh my god what is all this moaning about?  Yes it was written to 1945 standards.  But think about how progressive the 1927 Showboat (my favorite) seems, scripted by the very same Hammerstein.<br/><br/>My wife who is not an ""old musical"" lover adored it.  The singing was excellent all the way around, despite the inherent mismatch between an opera singer and everyone else. Renee Fleming is a true team player and a gift to humanity. Google her interview in the New York Post and see what I mean. You know when you go to a musical performed by actors who just learned to sing -- none of that here! And...the dancing is fabulous. The final starry act is Carousel and is bizarre, particularly if you are not expecting it.But, just go with it and enjoy. "
1253,Weekend,This revival of Carousel is a treasure. 
1254,Weekend,"Saw it early in previews.  Brought my 13 year old son.  We saw Spongebob, Hamilton and Sweeney, and Carousel was the show that has remained at his forefront over the past month.  The cast was spectacular, and Ms. Mueller could not have been more perfect.  I felt, at the time, that Soliloquy was paced too quickly, but that may have been remedied through previews.  Other than that, and the inherent flaws in the show's second act which Mr. Brantley referenced, this production is perfection.  It tells a story, and does so beautifully and gracefully.  It lets the characters live, flaws and all... the music is unparalleled."
1255,Weekend,"I shall be interested in seeing this production as it has received many conflicting reports including Mr Brantley's semi-enthusiastic assessment. The last production I saw was the magnificent Chicago Lyric Opera  mounting starring the superb Stephen Pasquale as Billy (his soliloquy stopped the show) and Laura Osnes set in the 1930's also co-starring Tony Bill and a magnificent Charlotte D'Amboise as Mrs Mullin.<br/>The Chicago production obliterated the tepid Quakery of  Lincoln Center's 1994 production that I found tedious,precious and unfortunate seeing that the Billy couldn't sing. It's only memorable revelation was Audra MacDonald.<br/>How interesting that one of the most ravishing scores in American Musical history graces one of its most difficult books that taken in today's societal context incites all sort of outrage. Sort of a modern day Merchant Of Venice. "
1256,Weekend,"""For its first two-thirds, though, this âCarouselâ tingles with the rapture of life in all its contradictions.""<br/><br/>And then, alas, when real life gets to close to a real contradiction, now regarded, context aside, as ""socially incorrect,"" there is the sound, not so much of reality muted but as in ""the cherry orchard"" at its close, of a broken string or, in this case, broken faith.<br/><br/>no wonder that a ""similar queasiness pervades much of the rest of the second act..."", it slinks ""almost as if hoping to pass unnoticed."""
1257,Weekend,"On the plus side: this production is beautifully sung.  The cast is outstanding.  However, the dance numbers are far too long.  This is an extremely old-fashioned production.  I am not sure to whom I would/could recommend it.  <br/><br/>The night that I saw it, I sat near a woman who had brought her daughter and two of her daughter's friends.  I can no longer readily discern ages.  The young women may have been in either high school or college.   The daughter, who sat next to me, continually checked her watch during the production.  I had the impression that her friends were also bored.<br/><br/>Finally, regarding sexuality, there was nothing in this production that recognized the pull of the erotic as much as Audra McDonald's rendition of ""Mister Snow"" in the 1994 production."
1258,Weekend,"An odd and inexplicably nasty put down of a fine, deeply insightful writer.  Wouldn't lose him for the world."
1259,Weekend,"You pay your $$ and get to have your opinion about what you saw. Don't agree or disagree with any of  you. As much theatre as I see, all cannot have the same observation. But for me, this I enjoyed very much, and I compare it to nothing!"
1260,Weekend,"I agree with Kathleen. I love musical theater and this review piques my interest, but I saw the movie a couple years ago with my young daughter and was appalled. Not because the story wasn't P.C. (we saw To Kill A Mockingbird the same summer), but bc the movie was presented (there and here) as a classic love story with all the idealized romance that implies. Unless this presentation is introduced with a message telling domestic violence victims where they can get help, then it needs to be retired. This story is a throw back in the same way Song of the South is. "
1261,Weekend,"I take it from your comments that you have not seen this production, but rather have seen the movie once, and many years ago.  I can tell you that there is no ""acceptance of violence against women"" that is threaded through the production.  The fact that Billy had struck Julie a single time was presented as horrific and was treated as such by her friends.  It was an act that underscored his self-loathing and the fact that he was an outsider, never accepted by the community.  Did Julie love him anyway?  Yes, of course, but that is hardly an unrealistic take on what can also happen in real life.  The ""slap that feels like a kiss"" moment will always be jarring and one wishes that R&amp;H could have found a different way to convey the fact that love can exist even within a deeply flawed character like Billy.  But I don't think anyone seeing the production will take that one moment at the end of the play as conveying ""acceptance of violence against women.""  Beyond that, at least for me, Carousel is ultimately about the music.  Surely the opportunity to experience the sheer glory of Carousel's music is worth enduring the dated elements of the story.   "
1262,Weekend,"I agree.  Thought it was the most brilliant of all the many Carousels I've seen.  Maybe the best production of anything I've seen in a long time.  The only previous production that comes close is the 1994 Lincoln Center version - a very different interpretation.  This one was, in a word, stunning.  I saw it twice during previews, and the audiences responded with real (!) standing o's.  Soliloquy blew the house apart.  Louise's ballet was beautiful.  And...oh, that Carousel Waltz.  Wow.  "
1263,Weekend,"You're not really from Toluca Lake, are you?"
1264,Weekend,"Billy does mentioned having worked in New York, and we never do know his origins."
1265,Weekend,"Good point! In fact some revivals of Carousel have it set in the atmosphere of The legendary B&amp;B Carousell in Coney Island, Brooklyn! Some people actually believe that The Coney Island landscape, and that ride which dates back to 1906 is where Rodgers &amp; Hammerstein got their inspiration for the musical!"
1266,Washington,"I fear this is only the beginning, a set-up of the president's further abuse of power with more pardoning of his coterie of misfits to follow. Presidential pardons, meant to restore justice to individuals wrongly convicted or to heal justice for criminal convictions wrongfully incurred during an unenlightened past, are also a means for all Americans to reflect on the values they underscore: equal justice for all. ""The quality of mercy is not strained; it droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven,"" Shakespeare wrote. Sadly, the pardon of Libby is not only strained but another stain of the president's continued soiling of our nation. "
1267,Washington,"Lyin' Liars protecting themselves.  Lying is now the new norm in our country.  Somehow we desperately need to bring back that Truth and Facts are what we base our society on.  We need to to hold our lawmakers to speak the truth. You can have different values but stick to the facts! As in the words of Paul Simon ""The Boxer"", ""A Man Believes What He Wants To Believe and disregards the Rest""."
1268,Washington,"I think Comey feels guilty for his misguided judgments that negatively influenced voters to reject Clinton shortly before the election and therefore put a horrible person in office, Mr. Trump.<br/><br/> While Comey is a strong and generally principled man, he IS human and needed to get his story out because it was eating him alive.  Whether it was wise to publish at this time remains to be seen. To criticize Comey for the ""sensationalist"" aspects of his book is silly. Trump IS the most ""sensational, lewd, crude, narcissistic'' human being our country has ever had thrust at us... a kind of collective  violation of decency akin to unwanted sexual advances. "
1269,Washington,"A partial redemption but still, he tipped the election to Trump."
1270,National,"There's still tons of money wasted on ""drug war"" nonsense - cut that.  Cut the sky-high salaries and outrageous pensions, while putting all of them on social security like the rest of us, too."
1271,OpEd,"Intellectual theories are determined by economic realities.<br/>The present period of unlimited, never ending, global world war, combined with the denial of any media voice to non capitalist views, is a natural breeding ground for far-right or even fascist theories (cf. Bannon &amp; Evola).<br/>Intellectual fashions aside, the real division of any capitalist society, between the owners of the means of production and those who labor for them, cannot be papered over or theorized away. The brutal reality of the class division of our society is the 800 pound gorilla in the room that thinkers like those named by Mr. Brooks--and Mr. Brooks himself--are paid to ignore. The working class is not a ""tribe,"" but the multi-racial majority of the population, exploited every day by the capitalist class and justified by their intellectual stooges."

1275,BookReview,Political correctness is the lie the democrats support. They're just mad that the republicans are better liars.
1276,BookReview,"I can hear the soft hum and the vibrations of all the bots being powered up in shady corridors tonight, the algorithms being put into action as the MAGA, anti Comey establishment prepares for a chemically toxic attack on Comey for having confirmed that the portrait we see of Trump is nothing more than a paint-by-numbers, self-seeking narcissist whose regards for the US and the rest of the world are forged by Fox News and the ever idolising worshippers who cannot see beyond his lies."
1277,BookReview,"One charter member of the ""resistance"" fawning over another charter member.<br/><br/>Yes, Trump is repellant, but it apparently never dawned on Comey that the hangers-on in the Clinton's orbit or on their payroll also look like a mafia family.  Also, what about HRCs behavior gave him the idea that she shared his concepts of playing by the rules any better than Trump did.<br/><br/>Every president tends to overvalue personal loyalty as a trait among subordinates -- often ultimately to their disappointment. Normally, they keep such instincts private.  Only Trump bugles his every whine and/or tantrum to the world.  If this singular stupidity ends up with charges of obstruction of justice, he has only himself to blame."
1278,BookReview,"Let's not forget that Comey was thrust into the spotlight by AG Loretta Lynch's recusal of herself after her visit with Bill Clinton on an airport tarmac, just as the email server investigation was wrapping up. Also, Comey was reportedly under pressure from FBI agents in the New York office to recommend criminal charges related to the operations of the Clinton Foundation, which may have been a factor in his decision to go public with reopening the email investigation 11 days before the election. Hopefully not tragically, we are past all that now. We are dealing with an unstable, willfully ignorant person in the Oval Office (who just confirmed everything Comey wrote about his demand for personal loyalty as the highest duty by pardoning Scooter Libby) who will not be removed by the GOP because he attracts the votes that keeps them and their donor base in power to pursue their retrograde agenda. "
1279,BookReview,"It's a good point about Trump not being able to laugh.  Put differently, Trump may get his best laughs at the misfortunes of others -- when he can make other people squirm.  As Comey says, not a good sign in any person, let alone a man as powerful as the president.<br/><br/>Healthy people can laugh at themselves -- and healthy people can admit their own flaws, as Comey does here.  I just can't imagine Trump laughing at himself or admitting he has any flaws -- and this emptiness in Trump is perhaps the most disturbing thing about him."
1280,BookReview,"Thank God for Jim Comey. FINALLY, we have a leader who is willing to stand up to Trump, and to call on Americans to do likewise. <br/><br/>I admire his courage in fighting this important battle for truth and rule of law, and for phrasing his fight in words and ideas that might call some of the less brainwashed Republicans back to their senses. "
1281,BookReview,"I'm predisposed to think that Comey's A Higher Loyalty is illuminating -- that the story it tells is well told, reasonably credible, worth taking very seriously.  <br/><br/>One bone I'd like to pick concerns that idea that the Trump administration is like a forest fire.  <br/><br/>It would be more accurate to compare it to the firestorm that burned well over a quarter of a million acres in northern California last fall -- at a cost of over $9 billion in insured damages, and at a predicted cost of over $85 billion to the US economy, to say nothing of over 40 deaths and 90,000 people forced to evacuate.  <br/><br/>My point being that forest fires are relatively benign. "
1282,BookReview,"Interesting that: a) so much of Comeyâs sense of ethics is based on deep religious feelings and his reverence for the great theologian Reinhold Niebuhr, and b) Trump called the person so imbued with these values âa nut job.â<br/><br/>One wonders how trumpâs evangelical supporters feel about that.   "
1283,BookReview,Comey strikes me as a flawed but good man.<br/><br/>Trump strikes me as a broken creature of infantile passions.<br/><br/>There you have it.
1284,BookReview,"Not only is Trump behaving like a Mafia Don, the entire Republican Party is behaving like they are all made men and (I guess this is a first) women. "
1285,BookReview,"I loathe Trump and all he stands for. YET Comey seems to me to be a legend in his own mind as well. The country's savior, so he thinks, and his actions against Hillary Clinton were SO out of bounds that, yes, he DID deserve to be fired, and having Trump be the one to do it, in an abortive attempt to stop the Russia investigation, is ironic beyond irony.<br/><br/>The result is that Mueller is handling the investigation with more honor, dignity, and perspicacity than Comey can even dream of.<br/><br/>Good riddance."
1286,BookReview,"An interesting point for further evaluation might be to determine the percentage of votes cast before the Comey revelations, especially that in late October regarding reopening of the Clinton investigation. Voting by mail prior to election day is becoming more utilized. The impact of the statements could only be determinative, if at all, as to those voters who cast their ballot after the statements were made. The October surprise would have no effect on pre-election day voters. The value of a pre-election day statement or surprise may be shrinking. eg. the DUI revelation regarding Bush."
1287,BookReview,"The most telling phrase here is ""...Comey notes here that he had assumed from media polling that Clinton was going to win...""  He essentially admits that this hypothesis influenced his decision to make public his additional email investigations, even though he he knew it was highly unlikely he'd find anything new at that point.<br/><br/>In short, his actions, like those of many voters, were influenced by a gross mishandling of probability. There was no reason to be so sanguine at that point. The polls were not that lopsided. They were not that far off, but there was certainly the perception that they were. This incredibly poor journalism changed history."
1288,BookReview,"Can't stand either one of these characters, but side-by-side, Trump is far less credible. If I were on a jury, it would be a no brainier to choose Comey's testimony over Trump's. "
1289,BookReview,"There's a comparison in this review between Comey and Gary Cooper's character in High Noon.  It might be noted that in the movie many in the town thought that the sheriff deserved his ""comeuppance""."
1290,BookReview,The reason Trumpets are so perturbed is because it touched a truth deep within them. Reply to me. 
1291,BookReview,"Of course it is ""Persuasive"". If you are on the Liberal Train.<br/>Surprised the article did not end with a ""COMEY For PRESIDENT"" banner at the end. "
1292,BookReview,"We need to cut Mr Comey some slack here. As a disciple of Reinhold Niebuhr I'm sure there is no one who will beat up Comey more than Comey for the spiritual pride that led him to believe that Hilliary's error in judgment regarding  carelessness with her emails needed to be brought out immediately before her (seeming)  inevitable election.   The errors in judgment of Hillary and Mr Comey pale in comparison to the ongoing viciousness and stunning lack of integrity of the illegal occupant of the White House.  But these are people with a conscience  both of whom are probably their own worst critics. Mistakes in judgment, well atoned for and regretted , give it a rest guys. "
1293,BookReview,"Wow!  Thatâs all I can say after getting to the end of this piece... Was this ghost written by Comey?  There is a permanent government in DC. As this article acknowledged it is passed down from president to president. They by in large feel that their bosses come and go but they are the real power structure in the country. They build friendships and coalitions across departments, they court and are courted by lobbyists that help them navigate the tricky ethics laws to make sure their backs can get scratched... Comey is the epitome of the swamp that Trump promised to drain. No one makes it to upper management like a general or director of the FBI without being a political operator. No one makes it to the top just by being âstraight laced.â He was appointed by Obama precisely because his higher loyalty was to the permanent government that leans towards the left because faith in government over the individual is not a conservative belief. It still remains to be seen what the âinsurance policyâ is that these high level operatives devised to protect the swamp. If itâs a salacious gossip dossier created by the Clinton campaign and widely distributed and disseminated by them just prior to the election or if itâs now going after Trumpâs attorney for paying off a porn star to not blab about their romp in the hay I donât see how that is going to be received as a legitimate excuse to go after a duly elected sitting president of the United States. The president is still at 50% approval..."
1294,BookReview,"The short version, James Comey is a Law and Order Conservative, who took his job very seriously, despite the environment in Washington DC...."
1295,BookReview,Persuasive?  In what alternative universe?
1296,BookReview,"What I'm struck by in this affair is not only that the depiction of Trump as a mob boss rings true but that maybe part of the reason we haven't had a lot of billionaires run for president, despite their resources, is that in order to make that much money, aside from leveraging a market or single-handedly discovering a revolutionary invention, a person would need to behave just as he does. Maybe Trump is sincerely surprised that the way he behaves is considered unethical by the rest of society because he's lived in a bubble where his behavior is the norm? I wonder what we would find if we looked into all billionaires' dealings so aggressively? It might not be pretty."
1297,BookReview,"Wow, there must be a lot of truth in Comey's book considering the level of vitriol in the comments here. Really has the trumpeters running scared. Considering that Trump lies at least 6 times a day, (if you doubt he's a liar just remember that he said he'd release his tax returns after the election, said he'd be too busy to play golf, said he had a bigger inauguration crowd than Obama, said the post office loses money on Amazon packages (that might not be a lie, just ignorance), said Mexico would pay for the Wall...you get the idea), and considering that Comey has never been shown to be a liar - except as he is contradicted by the lying Trump and Friends, my money is on Comey."
1298,BookReview,What no one seems to grasp is that those that voted him into office - DO NOT CARE - that he is a dirt bag. Compare him to a Mafia Boss all you like. I like it. We like it. It's what we wanted. <br/><br/>You just don't get it. The gloves have been off for a long time and there is a new game in town. Beware of attacking Trump. If Trump fails to clean up you had better get out of town and hunker in your bunker because the pitchforks are coming out.<br/><br/>We are not stupid.<br/>We are not blind.<br/>We see you exactly as you are and we move forward hoping for the best but expecting the worst.<br/><br/>History tells us he will fail.<br/>It is a dark day in America.
1299,BookReview,"The NYT would praise this book, and swear to its accuracy in portrayal of the president, if Comey stated that Trump would meet with him in a closet, wearing a clown suit, prior to Trump's going out and terrifying children on the D.C. streets late at night.<br/>Comey is as reliable and credible a source as the NYT itself- none of either at all.<br/><br/>Thank you, moderator."
1300,BookReview,"Apart from everything else, a most erudite review. "
1301,BookReview,"And yet, I'd still rather have Trump than Hillary who I view as a continuation of the Obama era.  All these ancillary issues that have arisen from the ridiculous Russia collusion issue have been a huge distraction that has not served the country well. Compared to Fast and Furious, the Benghazi fiasco, and  the IRS targeting scandal, Michael Flynn and Jeff Sessions talking to Russians in the course of their actual jobs seems pretty innocuous. Firing Comey and McCabe? Ditto."
1302,BookReview,"Sorry folks - Given Mr. Comey's tenure and conduct as Director of the FBI? You lost me at ""the country's norms and traditions"". No need to read further,  the hypocrisy I'm sure only grows by leaps and bounds from the very first paragraph.  "
1303,BookReview,It's common for fired career corrupt self serving employees to act like this.
1304,BookReview,"The problem with Comey stating that Trump is doing damage to this country's ""norms and traditions"" is that virtually all of America wants exactly this. Trump was elected to start that forest fire because Comey's ""norms and traditions"" stopped representing Americans decades ago. The more damage Trump does, the more power minorities, the poor and anyone who stopped bothering to vote see returned to their hands. If Comey serves ""A Higher Loyalty"" it isn't me, you or anyone we know. It's the governing elite. I don't need Coey's kind of loyalty. Frankly we fought a war two hundred and fifty years ago to shrug that garbage off."
1305,BookReview,"There must be a part of Comey which seeks to re-earn his stripes as an impartial public servant.  He sacrificed at least some of that reputation when he made the comments on Clinton two weeks before Election Day.  A strange, rookie mistake for an ace veteran FBI man.  What went into that decision?  Surely he considered the issue from all angles, including the political.  If he didn't consider the political, then he's an idealistic fool.  If he did, then he must've known the revelation would prejudice her campaign.  So now he seeks to salvage his reputation, and Trump needless to say offers the perfect opportunity.  A once in a lifetime chance to expose and drive out of office a corrupt President of the United States.   Neibuhr would be proud of this imperfect man. "
1306,BookReview,"That Comey disclosed the reopening of the Clinton email investigation but not the Trump-Russian one is certainly proof of his ineptness -- and contradicts the very concept he espouses (that the FBI deals in facts, not politics). <br/><br/>He is a pathetic figure -- a bumbling bureaucrat whose higher loyalty seems to be mainly to his own towering ego.  What significant purpose does his book serve other than himself?  <br/><br/>It's most likely effect is already becoming evident -- a rallying point for pro-Trump supporters.  Once more, Comey's lack of judgment will be a set-back for advancing justice and decency in our country.<br/><br/>It he's such a hot-shot lawman, why didn't he lock Trump up years ago -- long before Trump's run for election?  That would have been doing his FBI job in spades. Instead, we get his sniveling, tell-all memoir.  Not much stature, that guy. Over the long run, Comey will most likely go down as one of the most confused, muddled, and incompetent figures of this era."
1307,BookReview,"Once upon a time, it was universally agreed Eliot Ness and Will Kane were the heroes... Al Capone, Frank Miller the outlaws.  Trumps defenders and 'loyalists' .... have reversed that tried and true narrative reflecting American ethics and honor. Capone is now King."
1308,BookReview,"I note the parallel (probably intentional) in the title-- a Higher Loyalty-- to a book called A Higher Call (true story of WWII pilots..German pilot who risked his life to save a badly damaged American bomber struggling in German air space).  Franz the german pilot stays loyal to his ""higher"" principles of basic human decency and the principles of honor (even in battle) he had been taught growing up.  "
1309,BookReview,"Can't wait to see this guy, with handcuffs on.  So The President elect is briefed by the intel community in Trump Tower, must have been a star chamber there where you could discuss classified, right?  Then Comey admits he waited until everyone left, and then he had a ""private"" one on one, where he brings up the clinton/DNC dossier material. Every related time he tells us he is one on one with the President and he even makes notes.  Of course he makes no notes with Obama and Lynch, or McCabe.  Then this guy takes those federal property notes and gives them to a friend who sends them to the liberal media.  There is much more coming and he like others in the Obama Junta are telling their own tales that all conflict, should be interesting when they are interviewed as some of them already have been by the FBI/DOJ."
1310,BookReview,"Hogwash. Comey has written a polemic: Trump bad; me and mine (including Sec. Clinton) good. <br/><br/>I don't know a single elected official who does not demand personal loyalty of his staff. That Mr. Comey finds that unusual speaks to his stunning naivete as a public official or his willfully attempting to denigrate this president by misrepresenting Washington norms.  Trump's ""crime"" seems to have been overtly asking for an overt pledge of personal loyalty that is always demanded, albeit more discreetly, in the salons of Washington.<br/><br/>There will be a reckoning, but it's more likely to involved Mr. Comey's egregiously inept - and possibly criminal- oversight of Secretary Clinton's mishandling of classified information than Mr. Trump's awkward - but not illegal - management of his underlings."
1311,BookReview,"While I am looking forward to reading James B. Comey's book, I am concerned about how all of this publicity is affecting his family.  I also believe that there is something Biblical about this situation with a man named James, who has been thrust into one of the most momentous times in history. "
1312,BookReview,"I don't think Comey is a particularly evil guy, but come on...you can't honestly say he was a good FBI director. <br/><br/>Regarding the Hillary email case: the FBI's job is to very simply examine the facts and present their findings to Congress and the executive branch... not to manage public perception during an election year. This investigation was a total failure on both of these counts. It's very clear from Comey's behavior that he was deeply conflicted about the inner workings of the case... however, he had no right whatsoever to break with decades of FBI policy and start holding press conferences two weeks before the election. Talk about interference...<br/><br/>And furthermore, what FBI director in the history of the United States has gone on a book tour trying to vindicate himself? Ever heard of the saying ""guilty hollers""? I think it applies here. This man has been criticized by both Republicans and Democrats alike and with good reason. "
1313,BookReview,"Iâm reminded of that old story describing Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers in that Ginger did everything Fred did except she did it backwards and in high heels. Mr. Comey still doesnât get it. He put his thumb on the electoral scale by publicly hanging Mrs. Clinton out to dry by reopening or at leased saying that the case was still open and then publicly saying it hadnât found anything new within days of the election while giving a hall pass to Mr. Trump by not saying ANYTHING about itâs investigation into his campaignâs interactions with Russia. And while we are at it,I hope Mr. Comey addresses Rudy Giulianiâs using his connections at the New York branch of the FBI and his using those connections to further his politically motivated attacks on Mrs. Clinton. Iâll never forget his lupine grin when he predicted that something was coming down about the emails days before Mr. Comeyâs October surprise. "
1314,BookReview,"Does James Comey's higher loyalty include loyalty to the perpetrators of 9-11?<br/>How can anyone believe someone who is an accessory to murder?  Comey has loyalty; however, it is not to the American people."
1315,BookReview,"Comey probably did swing the election to Trump, but I find his explanation credible, that had he not been forthcoming about the status of the investigation, the Republican party would have tried to undermine a Clinton presidency by saying she was illegitimate.  (Let's face it, they tried to undermine Obama's presidency for eight years by saying that he wasn't born in the US, which was a total falsehood).  I guess is he also didn't publicly discuss the Russian interference into the election because at the time, at least, the investigation was limited to how Russians were interfering in the election, not whether or not Donald Trump/the Trump campaign colluded with the Russians to help Trump win the Presidency.  (The investigation has since expanded to include not just interference but collusion.)  Thus, it seems that James Comey was at least trying to do the right thing, and had logical reasons supporting his actions.  Despite his explanations, however, I still agree with the opinion of Rod Rosenstein--that the FBI  and DOJ should not comment on their investigations other than to say whether or not one is underway, and whether or not there will be prosecutions.  Still, given this mistake of Comey's--to go public with investigations--I don't blame him for the rise of Donald Trump.  I blame years of Fox News brainwashing an already vulnerable electorate in economically disadvantaged, undereducated, rural areas of the country who couldn't think critically to change a light bulb.  "
1316,BookReview,"When Comey told Congress that the Hillary Clinton investigation was closed, Congress made him promise to notify them if it were ever re-opened.  When it was reopened, after the discovery of the Weiner e-mails, Comey notified Congress, as he had promised to do. It was the Congressional Republicans who then leaked the information to the public.  I'm not excusing Comey - we all regret what turned out to be a horrible decision and clearly no one regrets it more than Comey himself.    "

1318,BookReview,They're hiring on the Iron Range. It's a big deal...
1319,BookReview,"Comey is already outed for lying so not buying what he writes in a salacious book.  He is trying to stay relevant, make money but mostly he with the others want to take Trump down. "
1320,BookReview,"James Comey is both victim as well as victor in his integrity. If he had refrained from resurrecting the Clinton ""investigation"" in the waning days of the 2016 election, he may well have kept his job."
1321,BookReview,"The man who brought disgrace, scorn and obloquy to the FBI, now tries to unseat a democratically elected president. Sad!"
1322,BookReview,"James Comey has a story to tell which is making him millions of dollars.  If he was so concerned about what he is writing about, he would have published it on the internet for free. "
1323,BookReview,"""and points out that he never saw Trump laugh""<br/><br/>I have often observed that every time I see Trump smile, which is rare to begin with, he seems like he is a humanoid alien imitating a human smiling.  I stretch my lips and bare my teeth: humans do this when they are trying to appear friendly."
1324,BookReview,"If Comey had actually been a competent FBI Director and had done his job properly, Hillary would have been indicted and the Democrats would have chosen someone else to run.<br/><br/>All of this self-serving hand-wringing is just to cover up how incompetent James Comey was.  Writing the exoneration letter before even interviewing the subject of interest, Hillary Clinton, bespeaks of deep political influence within him - the dishonor he brought down on the FBI still echoes.    <br/><br/>Trump was right to fire him and the real narcissistic is the author of this book, James Comey. "
1325,BookReview,When was the last time a fired employee had nice things to say about his ex-boss....got to be a fool to take any of this at its word.
1326,BookReview,"Comey certainly is one of the good guys. A professional with a good track record, standing up to a ego maniac pathological liar like Trump, a danger to our country.<br/><br/>However he seems to have one big flaw, a big mouth.<br/><br/>After declaring Hillary innocent of any charges he should have kept his mouth shut and not give an editorial opinion of her behavior. <br/><br/>He should have done the same thing if he found her guilty.<br/><br/>I am afraid now possibility with this book but in the future his need to blab will compromise any investigations going on now re Trump and his ilk.<br/><br/>Who should Comey emulate? He should follow Mueller's lead who keeps his mouth quiet until a charge comes out."
1327,BookReview,"It is easy to place partial blame on Mr. Comey for the disastrous outcome of the 2016 election but now that it is done, America has been painfully awakened to the direction embraced by the Republican Party: their blatant disregard for the less well being of our citizens: their destructive fiscal, debt-ridden policies and worst of all, their refusal to tamp down a malignant President. <br/><br/>This book will be, I am sure, one hundred times easier to read than ""Fire and Fury"" which I found disappointing. <br/><br/>America badly needs to get by Trump and start our return to good leadership. Hopefully Comey's book will be a start."
1328,BookReview,"When you're a hammer, everything looks like a nail.  The highlight of Comey's career was prosecuting a New York crime family.  Note that he was in the prosecution not an investigator, so he just took information compiled by others to piece together a plausible story.  It becomes very clear that his bias against Trump preceded the election.  His bias against prosecuting Hillary preceded her interview.  The Obama-Comey era was defined by using prosecutorial discretion to obstruct justice and allowing those under investigation to BleachBit and redact their subpoenaed documents.  Comey's FBI wasted time on petty politics while using minimum wage call center employees to screen the Orlando and Parkland shooters.  Strzok and Page make it clear the Comey was a lynchpin of their Secret Society.  He and his top staff broke the FBI ethics code by cultivating and feeding news reporters.  Both Mueller and Comey have caused the FBI to have to pay out huge judgments for malicious prosecution in the past.  His comments on Trump's mariage make it clear that Comey is the bully out to get Trump in spades."
1329,BookReview,"Comey is one of the swamp dwellers who was drained.  His book is typical of one who has lost his position of power and influence.<br/> Trump has many faults.  But praise the Lord he is not a Socialist or a Communist.  Why so many people think electing a Socialist or a Communist would be good for the USA is beyond me.  Do they want us to be the economic juggernaut that Eastern Europe is?  Do they want us to have the suicide rate of Scandinavia?  Russia and Comey are to blame for Trump?  No, Clinton is to blame for Trump."
1330,BookReview,"Comeyâs revelations in 2016 about the FBI investigations into Hillary Clintonâs emails were puzzling. Subsequently, we have all learned that the FBI was also investigating the Trump campaign about unsavory connections with agents of the Russian government.<br/><br/>Yet by many, many accounts Comey is a straight shooter. He believes in the concept of equality before the law and has sworn many times in his career to support, protect, and defend the Constitution. <br/><br/>If two presidential candidates have ongoing FBI investigationsâduring a presidential campaignâwhy reveal one and not the other? Comeyâs explanation that the public needed to know about the status of the Clinton email investigation in the summer and the more damaging revelation just before the election does not work well. He states that he wanted to avoid Clinton having an illegitimate presidency. That only begins to reveal what was going on. <br/><br/>Comey expected that Clinton would win and that he was trying to preserve the presidency. But by not revealing that the FBI was also investigating the Trump campaign he not only put a thumb on the electoral scale, he also put his thumb on the scales of justice. He acted in the belief that his revelations would not interfere with the election, but he failed to uphold is oath to protect the equality of every personâeven Trumpâbefore the law. <br/><br/>His failure to uphold equality before the law has saddled us with the greatest constitutional crisis since 1860 and the most dangerous president."
1331,BookReview,"Comey's scrupulousness and his relentless, even crippling, pursuit regarding his motives for action and inaction remind me of the scholar whose insecurity about his work forced him to consult a dictionary to confirm the definitions not only of every word he used, but also of every word in the definitions themselves; however, the fact that neither the Twit-in-Chief nor HRC like him is the enviable equivalent of two feathers in his cap.<br/><br/>Regardless of Comey's soul-searching meanderings, he got it right and unquestionably deserves all the praise history will undoubtedly shower on him."
1332,BookReview,"Is there a mention about leaking information to a Columbia professor, in addition to others?"
1333,BookReview,"The idea of Trump as a mob boss presiding over a criminal administration is a comparison that seems all too apt. <br/><br/>Whatâs more disturbing to contemplate is how easily the Republican Party has embraced the same model of loyalty over ethics, Party above country, destruction of norms, lies, rampant misogyny, racism, entrenching themselves in power by whatever means they can get away with...<br/><br/>Follow the money, follow the deals, follow the pandering to special interests. The Republican Party looks like a criminal organization that should be a prime candidate for a RICO case."
1334,BookReview,"Interesting, to read the articulate, thoughtful comments in this thread, vs what one can read in other threads that 'side' against stand-up citizenry, justice and rule of law. Bravo to all contributors."
1335,BookReview,"Comey had his chance to shine before the election: Instead, he threw a present to Trump by announcing the Hillary Investigation. He had his second chance when he testified in Congress, and he had the world glued to the TV screen. Instead, he proved a forlorn witness to nothing but his own press leaks (which should have discredited him forever). Now it's too late to say anything. We have our President. The country did not fall apart in the 18 months he's governed: Indeed one can say the opposite has happened. Now the real deluge would come if one were to try and overthrow him. We probably wouldn't have a country after that."
1336,BookReview,Everyone has one' s own drama playing in mind reflecting daily interactions with the surrounding. Mine is most likely to resonate with Comey's and my (or perhaps anyone's) suspicion was Trump's is more akin to the Mafia's (and hence people would not support him). What was wrong with us was half the population liked the Mafia and elected him. 
1337,BookReview,"Hard not to see Comey as a tragic figure of near Shakespearean proportion.  His near slavish devotion to truth almost certainly gave give us Trump, the very antitheses of truth and of everything else Comeyâs life has stood for.  The irony that a man of unimpeachable honesty and honor, should be the instrument of giving us a President with absolutely no integrity or honor.<br/><br/>Talk about unintended consequences.<br/><br/>The book feels like a plea for redemption.  By eviscerating Trump perhaps Comey hopes to set right the mistake he made.  Is it possible that the lesson we all should learn is that truth has its own imperfections and must be wielded carefully, least it work in the service of lies."
1338,BookReview,"We are experiencing a very dangerous time in this country and it's because of Democrats who can't tolerate losing an election and are trying to undermine a sitting president, duly elected by the people of this country.    "
1339,BookReview,"I'm sure his precision prose will be read and re-read with great interest. The merits of publication now whilst there is so much volatility in the WH, his explanation over the Clinton email investigation, will gall both Trump and Clinton. <br/><br/>His book is not about winning friends but upholding his truth mission. Life under Trump is so toxic and unusual that those who escape the mogul's grip feel smirched and unclean - trying to make sense of such abuse compels honorable people to act.<br/><br/>There will be other books to follow Comeys and we should commend those brave enough to put their head above the parapet."
1340,BookReview,"The rule of law in USA is under attack by its own president, his appointees and Congress abetted by Fox News, Sinclair, shout media.<br/>It is disturbing to read comments about impact on HRC this or that.<br/>Forget HRC Bernie and last election; we're in an existential crisis being imposed upon us and a trustworthy man who tries to be honest and true should be listened to. Esp one with track record for diligence.<br/>If you don't believe him over Donald Trump is the question.<br/>Do you still believe in US rule of law?<br/>   Or can Trump 'get rid of' the entire investigation around him by a power play?  "
1341,BookReview,"I realize it is still very hard for true-blue Hillary supporters to accept the fact that she lost the election, but she did. The reasons were many and Comey was probably the least of it. It is unlikely that his announcement before the election made any difference. By then, most people had already made up their mind as to the candidate of their choice. <br/><br/>Hillary was a weak candidate. She had been widely disliked from the start and did little to change minds - let alone hearts. She is boring, folks, at best. Trump is many terrible things, but he was entertaining. That is America. We aren't a nation of deep thinkers. <br/><br/>Please let your animosity go. It changes nothing about the past, but it is poisoning the present and perhaps the near future. If you want a Democratic Congress, let go of Hillary. Embrace progressive candidates because that is where the future lies. The Third Way crew needs to take the highway. Their day is done. Don't hold on to neo-liberalism. It has never served us well. Let's take our country back together."
1342,BookReview,"Comey made a fateful decision but he is not the cause of the trouble we are in. The authoritarianism, the racism, the willingness to thwart democracy and jettison the rule of law in order to create something like Viktor OrbÃ¡n's Hungary here in America was already part of the plan the GOP had for us. Comey did not cause the Mercers and the Koch brothers to rig our elections with creepy Cambridge Analytica schemes, he did not systematically pursue voter suppression and he didn't work with the Russians to coordinate the release of hacked information. He played his own fateful part, but his part was just a tragic mistake."
1343,BookReview,I love Reinhold Niebuhr and this makes me to respect James Comey more. He is highly believed and very credible. We need more people like him in any society. 
1344,BookReview,"I very much look forward to reading the book and I thank you for this review. I remember how alarmed I was that Comey may have thrown the election. But that was before we understood how deeply compromised the electoral process had been by Trump/Russian ""mob"" interference, the ""alt-right"" and Cambridge Analytica/Mercers/Koch, and the utter corrupt practices of Facebook, Twitter, and other data-mining, profit-driven social media platforms. Already, Bernie Sanders had done his best to de-legitimize Clinton's campaign. Democracy is fragile and Comey and Niebuhr (and you) are right about the dangers of moral complacency and the necessity of entering the political arena to try to make a difference."
1345,BookReview,"Comey decided to reveal that the investigation of HRC had been taken up agains, but doesn't face head-on the nation-shaking implications of lending credence to the attacks on her by Trump.  Comey had his moral crisis  about this in public: I understand his reasoning about not concealing potentially important information from the voting public, but  -what about potentially damning background on Trump? - not to mention the Russian story.  Was something about HRC that made it easier to publicly cast shade on her than on Trump?  HRC, not unlike her husband, seemed to so some things which, common sense would have picked up, were going to become issues when she was under the microscope. But as to why Comey hit her hard - and not the Mafia Don-  I cannot help but wonder if it still isn't do to underlying misogynistic tendencies in law enforcement. "

1350,BookReview,"âThis president is unethical, and untethered to truth and institutional values,â Comey writes. âHis leadership is transactional, ego driven and about personal loyalty.â  And this is something we didn't already know?"
1351,BookReview,"While I appreciate Mr. Comeyâs candor at this moment to expose a corrupt presidency, I have not forgotten his announcement about reopening an investigation into Hillary Clintonâs e-mail server, days before the election. So in my eyes, he has only ever so slightly redeemed himself. "
1352,BookReview,"I bought the book.  I hope it is a good read, and informed.  I already sense a bit of humor from the man taller than the potus, also fired by same.  One thing that stands out for me is a quote regarding the potus being untethered from the truth, only an honest person viscerally shocked could make that statement.  A liar would never see the tether."
1353,BookReview,"While one cannot hang the election wholly on Comeyâs disclosure, right before the election, that the investigation into Clintonâs email had been reopened, we should remember that, only a few days before the election, Comey stated that the reopened investigation had, in fact, turned up nothing new.  If Comey want# to paint himself as a careful, thoughtful man and an honest broker, why did he not wait until he had all the facts before he dropped that October Surprise on to Clintonâs election bid?<br/><br/>I have no doubt that Comeyâs rendition of his medtings with Trump are accurate and truthful.  But the bad taste that his actions in October 2016 still leave a very bad taste in my mouth.  If he feels âmildly nauseatedâ when he thinks of what he did, imagine how a growing majority of the country feels."
1354,BookReview,"On the whole, I trust Comey much more than Trump or any of his sycophantic toadies; however, this statement shows him to be oblivious to the consequences of his actions: ""He adds that he hopes âvery much that what we did â what I did â wasnât a deciding factor in the election.â Truly clueless"
1355,BookReview,"Folks, if you think that anyone's vote was actually influenced by Comey's statements about Hilary Clinton, you have an absurdly high opinion of human responsiveness to facts.  People are going to vote for who they are going to vote based on identity and deeply imbedded values values and ideology.  Clinton would not have won FL, Oh, or PA if Comey had declared her pure as driven snow."
1356,BookReview,"I very much wish people were more intelligent and less easily manipulated.  Much as I despise Trump, this is an absurd book review.  Everything Comey says is taken at face value.  Not content with repeating Comey's praise of himself, which seems to be considerable, the reviewer takes it upon himself to editorialize and contrast Trump and Comey (to the detriment of Trump, obviously.)<br/><br/>But who is this guy really?  He's the creep who threw this election to Trump by announcing 11 days before an election that one of the candidates had been under investigation while concealing the fact that the other one was.  He knew EXACTLY what effect that would have.  In many European states, newspapers are not even allowed to report poll results within two weeks of an election, because they've been demonstrated to have too much of an effect on voters' perceptions.  So the announcement by the head of the FBI of an investigation was not trivial.  Also worth noting, the day after the election, Comey was honored by a group whose board includes several people with longtime ties to Donald Trump, including the CEO of the National Enquirer.  Does not pass the smell test.<br/><br/>Besides which, what kind of loser makes personal remarks about someone's height or hand size or hair or skin?  Donald Trump certainly does, and apparently so does Comey in his new book.  How is this guy better, again?  Sorry New York Times, the enemy of my enemy is not my friend.  This guy is as corrupt as they come."
1357,BookReview,Comey and Obama had more to do with Clintonâs defeat than any Russians. Comey knew about the Steele dossier in late summer 2016; but instead announces that one candidate is tainted on the eve of the election. Obama also knew about Russian interference in the summer of 2016 and in an amazing display of irresponsibility applauds Comey for his integrity 
1358,BookReview,"as a wise man once said, the greatest harm is perpetrated by those who watch it happen"
1359,BookReview,"Comey didn't choose self-preservation and abdication. He chose to risk making a decision, judgment from which he would be inseparable, independent of outcome. We should be thankful it was he in that position at that time and not a lesser man as the one occupying the Presidency.   "
1360,BookReview,"Trump is a treasonous sham. The GOP who have enabled and allowed him to continue are equally destroyers of our democracy. Comey isn't my favorite based on his part in making sure Trump is where Trump is; however, I don't doubt what he's saying because all the stories about Donald and his cheating, criminality are consistent, person to person. "
1361,BookReview,"In reading this review, there were times when I wasn't sure if the reviewer was writing a review, or editorializing!"
1362,BookReview,Whoever wrote this has the best writing skills I have ever seen.
1363,BookReview,Comey's book will make fascinating reading I'm sure. His descriptions of Trump makes me think of a work addressing which of various leaders of the US and UK had hubris traits or syndrome. Wonder what the authors would make of Trump in this regard? 
1364,BookReview,"A dangerous time indeed.  Thank you James B. Comey for speaking truth about the disaster unfolding in our country because of Trump.  The similarities between the Mob and Trump, with the us-versus-them worldview and requirement of complete loyalty should shake some of those still Trump people out of their stupor.  More than holding out hope for that to happen, we all need to vote this mobster and the complacent Republican party out of office.  The time is now for all of us to take action, first and foremost at the ballot box."
1365,BookReview,"Comeyâs October surprise changed the election.  He joins Elian Gonzalez, Ralph Nader, the designer of the butterfly ballot, Jill Stein and the Supreme Court (the 2000 election and Citizens United 5-4 decisions) as agents that changed history for the worse, even if unintentionally.   How fragile we are."
1366,BookReview,"Let's be clear...<br/>The Comey book means nothing in the end. James Comey is not a Saint, he is duplicitous and self important. In my opinion, he is just as responsible for the election of Donald Trump as anyone. "
1367,BookReview,"Comey made some bad decisions that prejudiced the candidacy Hiary Clinton. Of course we will never know whether those decisions made the difference.<br/><br/>His take on Trump and reactions to Trump's corrupt character, appear to have been right on the mark.<br/><br/>One way or the other, he will likely have influenced two elections and, thereby, the ongoing fabric of U.S. history and government."
1368,BookReview,"Comey is a life long Republican, just who we need to speak up during these chaotic times.  "
1369,BookReview,"The truth hurts, doesn't it?"
1370,BookReview,"Intimidated? You mean like he wishes he could have talked back to the bully but couldn't, as you-know-who wrote in her you-kn0w-what."
1371,BookReview,"No it was the Russians.  and Bernie Sanders. and maybe Barack Obama. and misogyny (her biggest lie about that) It certainly wasn't her abysmal chemistry with the electorate. or ""basket of deplorables"". or long history of lying."
1372,BookReview,"I am continuously stricken by the false equivalency of using an outside email server with all the stuff associated with Trump. For goodness sake, email !! Past SecStates and even Presidents used outside email servers. "
1373,BookReview,"I disagree. Clinton was barely hanging on to a small lead that was evaporating. I honestly believe that the emails had nothing to do with the results. Where I voted, most progressives wanted Sanders and refused to vote for Clinton. She was a flawed candidate, but the best choice of the two. Here is hoping our country never has to decide, again, on two such disliked candidates."
1374,BookReview,He's a kiss and tell deep stater cashing in on his twisted celebrity status.
1375,BookReview,"Ok Mr President, I see your all caps there and I get that you're still angry. Play some golf this weekend and try to relax."
1376,BookReview,Whoâs trumps tax accountant? 
1377,BookReview,"Despite all the noise, fact is he has accomplished nothing.  He was a cheerleader for the revised tax legislation, he's rolled back some exec. orders and all his policies end up in court.  Maybe he had a hand in managing the response to Texas floods.  Other than that, he's done nothing (which in the end just may save us) but rack up bills for weekend trips, played golf and use the office to further enrich himself and his family."
1378,BookReview,"Except when you deliberately start the forest fire and it engulfs our economy, infrastructure and people. "
1379,BookReview,"@Mike Vitacco: Um, Mike, her emails were published all over the place. I read many of them right here in the NY Times. Other news outlets published some of them, too. <br/><br/>The reason you may not remember them is that most of them were boring and contained nothing that most people who read regulalrly did not already know. No secret child-porn pizza rings or other nefarious schemes were the topics of her emails, so I guess those of you desperate for scandal and crime simply did not pay attention. "
1380,BookReview,"@JEYE: Yes, everybody seems to forget about those letters from the House Republican committee, demanding information from Comey! I remember reading copies of them here in the Times, and thinking to myself that a lot of Republicans in the House were desperate, to be badgering the FBI director like that for dirt."
1381,BookReview,"Patriots don't poison elections like comey did.<br/>He's a partisan hack who gave the freak the white house and our country's once sterling reputation will never recover.<br/>Comey is worse than trump because trump has no clue what he's doing.<br/>Comey knew exactly what reopening the email nonsense would do that is why he obeyed the koch brothers his real bosses, and did it."
1382,BookReview," Metaphoric, my friend. "
1383,BookReview,"Thank you for your reply Tommy. You have a legit point of view, don't know whether I agree with it or not.<br/><br/>Again, my view, and I am at fault for the terminology, by good buy I mean honest and a professional, not perfect.<br/><br/>Again I think his biggest fault is that he has a big mouth. "
1384,BookReview,"Thank you for your reply akramden. Again, as mentioned Comey is a ""good guy"", meaning a professional, loyal American who has a big mouth and now wants to cash in on it. <br/><br/>Better than a bigot, rabble rouser, pathological liar, admitted sexual predator, philanderer, border line Russian spy, ego maniac demagogue like Trump. <br/><br/>If you look at it from my view, Comey looks like Lincoln, Trump looks like democracies' answer to a despot. "
1385,BookReview,Nail meet hammer! Well said. It's crazy that Americans are so asleep at the wheel that they aren't concerned with complicit legacy media getting in bed with one political party to the detriment of the country. Talk about turning a blind eye.
1386,BookReview,"Yes, great point. And wasn't it Comey's duty also to inform voters of both investigations underway. A big question mark is why he didn't reveal that DJT was also under investigation?"
1387,BookReview,Fox News has a completely different narrative
1388,BookReview,Fortunately you're going to be disappointed. 
1389,BookReview,"It is incredibly simplistic to blame ""the deeply misogynistic culture in this country"" for Hillary Clinton's defeat.  As the popular vote proved, many<br/>Americans voted for a woman.  The problem was, as has been stated many times, this Particular Woman. Surely, the opposite of misogynistic is not any woman who decides to run for President.  This is the contribution of dyed-in-the-wool lefties to the political mess we find ourselves in."
1390,BookReview,"Hold on.<br/><br/>Did you actually live through  this time? Because the media itself (headed by sexist men like Matt Lauer) tore Clinton to pieces, the stupidity and bigotry of Trump voters made itself clear,  and very stupid, very short sighted ""anybody but Clinton' voters put Trump in the White House. Part of living in a democracy is taking responsibility for your vote, and the majority of the White electorate is to blame for Trump in the WH, not Comey."
1391,BookReview,"Standard distributions models may be appealed to in the absence of other information, but why appeal to them when we know that great majority of voters were, in fact, very strongly committed?  Furthermore, to the extent there was very weekly committed population large enough to have any effect of the outcome, it is very doubtful, I suggest, that this population is comprised of citizens carefully following the beltway developments.  If by late October you have not been ensnared by Fox or were blind to Trump's manifest faults, you had your head so deep in the sand that Comey's email later remarks would have little effect.  <br/><br/>Personal experience: I went door to door in African American areas of Detroit to get out the vote.  The people I spoke were unexcited about Clinton, compared to Obama, for obvious reasons.  Comey, to the extent they knew who he was, was not going to effect anything."
1392,BookReview,"Maybe not the deciding factor, but a deciding factor<br/><br/>Black swan events happen due to a statistical alignment of low probability or low impact events. No single on is responsible, yet each single one is responsible"
1393,BookReview,"I don't know how any Republican reconciles their goals, values, interests, and philosophy with those of Jesus. They are opposite. If Republicans had a religion that matched their fundamental beliefs and purposes, it wouldn't be Jesus plus God the Father, it would be Ayn Rand plus Thor. Instead of reading Niebuhr, Comey should read the Gospels."
1394,BookReview,"Hillary was going to lose no matter....she arrogantly dismissed large segments of the country, didn't visit crucial states....her campaign had obvious tactical errors. History will eventually show that Comey's antics were a side show."
1395,BookReview,The answer to your question is clearly stated in the review. Take a look. It makes perfect sense. 
1396,BookReview,"He helped put that lesser man in the WH, Blee.  Now he is trying to back away from his actions 11 days before the election."
1397,BookReview,"Was it honest to reveal an investigation of Clinton's e-mails, stating there was nothing found at that point; however, the investigation was ongoing?  And, to not reveal that there was a parallel investigation of Trump?  All of this 11 days before a critical election date?  His honesty remains questionable.  And, after all that, Trump fired him."
1398,BookReview,"There are two quotes from Nietzsche. Thus Spoke. Zarathustra of which I am reminded<br/><br/>First, on Trump, ""At best I could regard you as the ventriloquist of the earth; and always when I heard overthrowing and underhanded scum-devils speaking, I found them to be the same as you: salty, lying and superficial.  You know how to bellow and to darken with ashes! You are the best big mouths, and youâve learned more than enough about bringing mud to a boil.""<br/><br/>And on the need for those with knowledge of his behaviour,   ""I see and have seen worse, and some of it so hideous that I do not want to speak of everything, and of a few things I do not want to remain silent...""<br/><br/>."
1399,BookReview,"We need a whole lot more discernment than your strident comment. Hillary won the popular vote. She also won the primaries by a convincing margin. She lost the election due to some very serious obstacles that we absolutely must track down. Mueller will hopefully help us understand the extent of it. I am past blame, I want to save this country."
1400,BookReview,"All human beings have opinions. Including reviewers who are NOT trying to follow the dictates of the Fairness Doctrine that the republicans (who else?) overturned. It is up to you, the reader, to separate the wheat from the chaff. Look at how many people are re-prosecuting Hillary Clinton for a failed campaign that actually got three million more votes than trump! You just have to focus, Counter Measure, and you have to measure out counter-measures to the editorializing that you allege to see. I thought it was a thoughtful review."
1401,BookReview,"Thereâs a byline. You should read her other reviews, too. "
1402,BookReview,"@Omalena<br/><br/>""Comey IS a liar!"" presumably absolves  Trump form a similar accusation in your twisted mind. Now let's look at Comey's transgressions: ""he lies under oath"" is a federal crime, yet the Republican led Congress did not pursue this accusation, nor that of deceiving Congress. Overturning tradition is not a crime (nor a lie for that matter); in comparison Trump overturns traditions and decorum just about every day, to the embarrassment of most Americans and ridicule by the rest of the world, yet that sad fact and his well documented factual distortions and lies does not seem to face you at all. How sad!    "
1403,BookReview,Such a reviewer might be exceedingly hard to find.  I loved her take on this book and her writing as well.
1404,BookReview,"See the quote in Michael Shear's article that ""he was primarily concerned that if he concealed the renewed investigation, it would make her an 'illegitimate president.' ""<br/><br/>Does he not see the jaw-dropping irony that concealing Hillary's emails might delegitimize her, but not concealing the investigation of Russian interference to elect Trump?"
1405,BookReview,Wife and daughters voted for Clinton.
1406,BookReview,"The FBI had never investigated to see if this ""new"" information was new, or just duplicate emails. So indeed they had no more reason to bring the emails up than the suspicion of Russian collusion. Comey had no business bringing it up unless he wanted to sink Hillary."
1407,BookReview,"I don't think you can say inadvertent, since he did it twice. It was intentional, on some level."
1408,BookReview,"An unwritten rule that ""no opinion be given that close to the election"". This when  FISA Warrants were authorized  less than two weeks before the election to wire tap and otherwise authorize surveillance of a duly nominated candidate of a major political party? Let's play fair sir..."
1409,BookReview,"He didn't comment about that, did he?"
1410,BookReview,I don't think it was malicious on Comey's part.<br/><br/>He just royally ROYALLY screwed up. <br/><br/>Helping elect trump is about as gigantic a screw up as anyone could possibly make in life. 
1411,BookReview,"Hillary Clinton, as perhaps the only candidate who could have lost to Donald Trump, should be added to Missouri Mike's list of ""agents that changed history for the worse, even if unintentionally."" As long as Clinton backers are unable to accept responsibility, history is doomed to repeat itself."
1412,Investigative,"Right-wing extremists have waited a long time for their chance to destroy our government -- and our natural resources. Congratulations, you're all doing a great job. We won't forget."
1413,Investigative,"The voters are really the last check on the kind of corruption and abuse of office taking place in Washington, as the Republican Congress refuses to take any action. If they aren't voted out en masse in November and replaced with politicians willing to reign in this administration, this whole experiment in democracy has failed. "
1414,Investigative,That's nice. Can I have my national monuments back yet?
1415,Investigative,It is my belief that Pruitt and Perrotta both know that Pruitt is doing the wrong things and hence the guilty paranoia on their parts. These two have no compunctions about ripping the taxpayer off and apparently don't care if they poison the environment either. Pruitt's motorcade is laughable and bizzare.
1416,Foreign,"Mr. President, have finished reading the U.S. Department of Commerce 2018-2022 Strategic Plan regarding China and the Pacific Rim countries yet? <br/><br/>Did you think I was serious when I asked you for it last week? Hey Sarah. He didnât know I was kidding about this [waves document in the air over his head]."
1417,Foreign,"Dear China,<br/><br/>When your experts figure Trump out, could you drop us a line and let us know what the answer is?<br/><br/>Thanks,<br/><br/>America"
1418,Foreign,"I hope the Chinese are consulting psychiatrists to try to understand Trump, because Trump has no coherent economic or foreign policies.  He relies on Fox News and the voices in his head.  Same difference."
1419,Foreign,"This article legitimizes Con Man Don and his administration, essentially implying that there is a there there. Of course the Chinese can't figure Trump out â neither can anybody else â especially Donald Trump. <br/><br/>The man is trying to do what one is supposed to do when confronted by a dangerous wild animal like a cougar â raise your arms and look as big as you can, hoping the beast will turn tail. Trump's running scared, has no idea of what he's doing and no interest in trying to find out. But wants to look big, look important, look like he's the only one who can Make America Great Again by scaring off the Chinese dragon. <br/><br/>Instead of trying to figure Trump out, as our hapless media is always doing, simply acknowledge that he's not in control of himself or his emotions, and work on getting him out of the way ASAP so we can reintroduce consistency into our national behavior."
1420,Foreign,"Yea, but the only problem is that they are using our stolen technologies to do it."
1421,Learning,"Before watching the video I already knew that Chicago was of the most dangerous cities in the U.S, I knew nationwide it had some of the highest crime rates for example assault it is 5.58 per 1000 people, Robbery is 4.43 for 100 people, and ect. But after watching this video I think it gives more of a perceptive of life for high schoolers that live in areas of high violence. In the video they describe when they went to go talk to the parkland shooters and the kids said where used to see people being shoot, which shows the true difference between kids living in high crime areas between kids that donât. One thing that I love about the video is how brings to light the problems in cities like Chicago.    "
1422,Learning,"High school age students can be the game changers in America's Gun Death Epidemic.  A lost life is a lost life regardless of it being from Parkland, Chicago, or any other city or town, and regardless of a tragedy happening on the streets or in schools.  Students, you are powerful, and you can 100% make a difference; ignore the naysayers and adults who think you're too young.  Stay focused and determined because you are the leaders.  The time for action is now.  To quote Dr. King, ""An injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.""  Stay strong."
1423,Business,"This is nothing short of an immense failure of Donald Trump and the incompetent staff that surrounds him.  He insults everyone involved in TPP, pulls out in a snit, then wants back in.  What incentive do any of the players have to let him, and by extension us, back at the table?  Let's face it.  They have every reason not to let us back in.  They're doing just fine without us and our childish ""leader"".<br/><br/>The art of the ignoramus."
1424,Business,"Oh TPP you know me? Trump's new rap song. After all, Trump has hired a warmonger, Bolton to be a warmonger and he's also going to fully pardon a Neocon, Scooter Libby.  This is shaping up to be ""Strategery 2.0""  Them Republicans are apparently nostalgic for more GOP buffoonery. "
1425,Business,"Well that is embarrassing, wonder if the alliance will let us now play."
1426,Business,"Completely sane, rational logic here, nothing to see folks !<br/> Wow, just wow.<br/>Any chance that some of his base now feels stabbed in the back ??<br/>Nah."
1427,Business,Any man or woman who ran a company of any size who governed it like Trump is governing this country would be out be out of a job within weeks.<br/><br/>This guy doesn't know what he is doing from one day to the next.<br/>Get him out of the job and get him mental health assistance -- at his expense.
1428,Business, So now  Trump is hurting  his own supporters and wants the general public to bail him out.  He is so erratic that our former allies do not want to go along with him. It is understandable. It would be great  if we had a president who knew what he was talking about.  How long  can America suffer because of  Trump.   The republican congress is  hurting itself as well as all of us by  just going along with Trump  rather than  represent the people and the  General  Welfare which according to the Constitution is their  true role
1429,Business,The trade deal was put in place to respond to China's growing economic influence.  Trump is his ham handed misinformed way just pulled the US out of it.  Now he is in the panic mode and trying to get the US back into the pact.  Trump is a disaster.  Farm states were a big part of Trump's 2016 victory.  They are certainly much wiser about Trump now.
1430,Business,"When he says ""Obama was right, I was wrong, and I will fix what I broke"" then I will believe he is not the imbecile I know he is. "
1431,Business,"Pretty soon he will changing his mind about running for office. The Trans Pacific and NAFTA, and NATO all things he knows zero about. He better hope the Russians donât start talking because they know who they colluded with.<br/>Dead Man Walking"
1432,Business,"What we're seeing as a reversal of policy is actually the rocking motion produced by the unstable, impulsive, reactive man himself. "
1433,Business,"Or put another way, âTrump has no idea what he is doing.â"
1434,Business,"When Trump was talking about the TPP during the campaign he said the Chinese would come in through the back door like they always do. This was mere babble with no apparent actual meaning. But the folks drawn to the likes of Donald Trump no doubt thought it was really smart. Doesn't say much for their intelligence, now does it?"
1435,Business,Where to start?  He leads us on with wild promises and we take the bait and he says WHOA when all the other players call him out for his amazing lack of understanding and insight and he backtracks on the very basic promises to his base because now the promises he is keeping are actually hurting the base he vowed to protect and now they are hurting and turning on him so now he thinks (he thinks?) that maybe that was not a good idea so he's doing a 180Â°.  I need a new neck because this one is totally kaput from the twisting and snapping.  This man has not the first clue.  Not one.

If he is looking for a bible verse to inscribe along with his name on his vision of the EPA logo, might I suggest Proverbs 21:26â<br/>âHe covets greedily all day long...â"
1446,Climate,The self-importance and nakedly low character of Scott Pruitt is both shocking and sickening. But these qualities are the coin of the realm in the Trump administration.  
1447,Climate,"One of the biggest sources of methane that each of us can deal with right now is the methane that comes from dairy cows and beef cattle (belched out the mouths as well as coming out the rear and in their manure). These are the worst animals by far for this methane production and globally they account for a large share of greenhouse gas emissions. <br/><br/>Opposition from the dairy and beef lobby is one reason why carbon priciing is being delayed. The reason is that any methane price should be at least 25X that of any carbon price. <br/><br/>People can reduce or stop their consumption of dairy milk, cheese, whey protein or beef and immediately reduce their personal footprint causing climate change by cutting this methane source. <br/><br/>Methane is critical as a greenhouse gas as it is more than 25X more effective than CO2 at trapping heat and causing climate change. However, a bonus is that methane drops out of the atmosphere in just 10 years (as opposed to the 100 years it takes for CO2). Therefore, the milk, whey or beef you don't eat today will deliver a benefit in your lifetime and in just a few years. <br/><br/>This is a climate action that everyone can appreciate and implement starting right away."
1448,Climate,I'm so happy to see a tech x climate story getting covered! Keep them coming; my interest in tech is a futuristic curiousity about what kind of sustainable tech we can create to help manage our natural resources and solve environmental (our habitat!) issues. 
1449,Climate,"A laudable approach to this environmental problem but my concern is with the maturity of the technology - especially flight heritage.  Development and flight qualification issues can easily blow through budget and schedule leaving the sponsoring organization high and dry.  Conversely, cutting such needed activities short is a prescription for failure in flight.  Space is an unforgiving environment.  By all means go forward; never has such independent action been warranted more. "
1450,Editorial,"Well put but falls on deaf ears, Iâm afraid."
1451,Editorial,"Let's try this scenario on for size:<br/><br/>You have a new boss in your organization, which puts you in a position of power. You will be able to get a significant amount of your agenda passed. You would have preferred an alternative, but that's who in charge. You try to work with him on a typical agenda, but it is clear that he has acted at cross-purposes and bred unrest and dysfunction. The boss is incompetent, petulant, and scandal beset. His leadership is unstable. Any sane person would leave, as many others have/are/will left/leaving will leave. In the wake of this mass defection, the remaining actors will consist of virulently pro and anti forces that are unwilling and unable to cooperate.<br/><br/>I don't agree with much of Ryan's agenda, but he is competent and I doubt that the last has been heard of him. Hopefully, he will take the opportunity for reflection and gain some insight from the current disaster. We may have need of an evolved version of him in the future."
1452,Editorial,"Wishful thinking NYTimes, but the damaged has been done and redemption is out of reach. Tax cuts to benefit the wealthy and repeated attempts to repeal programs that benefit the common people are Paul Ryan's only legacy. You can try to change the man's character but you can't change his character. "
1453,Editorial,"The ONLY way Paul Ryan could be ""saved"" is to lead the House to impeach Trump.  We've seen over and over again that lame duck Republicans, or Republicans who've left office, have absolutely no influence on how their (former) colleagues deal with Trump.  NOW is Ryan's chance to cast aside his personal philosopy of self-centered ""objectivism"" and to put the good of the country ahead of himself.  What has he got to lose?  But he has everything to gain, including his ""legacy"" and the ability to look his grandchildren in the eye."
1454,Editorial,"April 12, 2018<br/><br/>How wonderful and impressive this Editorial gives counsel in the spirit of comrade  solidarity to common cause for Paul Ryan deepest reflections for his preserving his achievements as a good public servant that will give further account to the grater historical narrative personally and as an elite public servant of his Party and its meaning to his own further words, and acts ahead -while best to his new path for our American family where brothers and sisters can disagree and transparently beneficial.    "
1455,Editorial,I'm sorry but Ryan is nothing but a complicit rat who's jumping off a sinking ship.
1456,Editorial,"Shameful and good riddance! Like other spineless Republicans who are ""retiring"", they are off to enjoy their artificially, obscenely and unsustainable tax cuts and pension and health care on the people's dime.<br/><br/>American cannot ""retire"" from the damage this group has caused our country and continue to live with a trump in the house."
1457,Editorial,"Since Paul Ryan is a soulless, gutless,sychofant nothing will change except that our children and grandchildren will pay dearly for his smarmy smile and self serving politics."
1458,Editorial,"And don't forget the failure of Paul Ryan to reign in the<br/>partisan excesses of Trump's sycophant on the house committee, Devin Nunes, who turned what was supposed to be an investigation about collusion with the Russians into a Republican political circus designed to vindicate the president.  "
1459,Editorial,"If there are ever companion books entitled ""Profiles in Cowardice"" and Profiles in Duplicity"" they will prominently feature Paul Ryan. Anyone looking to Ryan for any sort of moral leadership just because he is leaving office and is somehow ""free"" to speak, fails to grasp how worthless and amoral Ryan is, and has always been. Ryan's entire career has been predicated on lies, whether patently false budget numbers, or blatant lies about his prowess, like his marathon lie. It would have held up if not for Runner's World having determined in 2012 that Ryan lied. As Runner's World stated: ""It turns out Paul Ryan has not run a marathon in less than three hoursâor even less than four hours. A spokesman confirmed late Friday that the Republican vice presidential candidate has run one marathon. That was the 1990 Grandmaâs Marathon in Duluth, Minnesota, where Ryan, then 20, is listed as having finished in 4 hours, 1 minute, and 25 seconds."" That anyone is looking to Ryan to ever do the right thing is a sad commentary on how desperate some have become. It's no different than all those who said that the sensible people surrounding Trump would temper and control him. We all know how that worked out. The day of decent Republicans is long gone. Long ago the Republican purge of any ""Republican In Name Only (RINO)"" drove what very few sane Republicans were left out of the Party. Don't expect anything from any Republican. They are the problem; not one of them is a part of any solution."
1460,Editorial,"As in, whether Mr. Ryan remains a moral coward, or speaks outs giving voice to every thread of decency which every allusion to his children entails.  That is, will Mr. Ryan, who in some ways represents the moral conscience of the GOP writ large, express that which is on the tip of his tongue, that everything DJT symbolizes is the antipode of what he aspires for, regarding his children's future.  Or will he continue to deflect, or worse, remain silent?  It's an empirical question, and we shall all have the answer by November..."
1461,Editorial,"Paul Ryan is making an excellent decision for his life planning by leaving Congress while he's young and still has time for another career.<br/><br/>As a retired psychologist and career counselor, I applaud his judgment.<br/><br/>Young people who consider a career in politics can take a lesson from Paul in the value of making a contribution to public office and then moving on to another endeavor!"
1462,Editorial,What this editorial says would amount to a confession and thus will never happen. 
1463,Editorial,"Ryan has been a key purveyor of incredibly bad ideas for such a long time that talking about his redemption at this late date seems a bit silly. Disguised as a conservative policy wonk/genius during much of his career, the only useful thing left to say about this cruel, fair-haired boy is ""good riddance."""
1464,Editorial,"Ryan will never ""step up.""  First, he is a media creation -- policy wonk, economic wizard, young, vibrant thinker.  That is the image he cultivated and the media ate up.  In reality, he is an Ayn Rand acolyte out to diminish people who need help to get by.  He succeeded with the Trump tax favors for the rich.  Ryan is looking to leave and rake in the big bucks with Fox, J Street, and right wing think tanks. This isn't about spending more time with his family. He is losing at home and is heading for the Republican barns before he collapses. "
1465,Editorial,"Paul ""Lyin"" Ryan do the right thing?  It is more likely that I will win the Powerball---the day after I win the Mega Millions."
1466,Editorial,"Frankly I think Paul Ryan is absolutely a narcissist. Show me where he has empathy and where he has done anything for those that really suffer in our country and state. He is cold, entitled, heartless and dishonest causing great harm to Wisconsin and our country to his parties advantage but our states loss. Go crawl under a rock Ryan. We donât want you around here. even your own city doesnât want you. When you look in the mirror you see something you are not and never will be. Shame on you for all the harm you have caused so many when you were given so much. And shame on you for continuing to take and take and take. "
1467,Editorial,Take heart. Republicans vested their future on another callow right-winger who was only 45 when his term as Veep expired in 1993. Dan Quayle can gladly welcome Ryan to the dustbin of history.
1468,Editorial,"A true ""rugged individualist"" is a hermit, living alone, away from roads  the grid, or a phone.<br/>A CEO of a corporation, a hedge fund manager, or a politician is not a rugged individualist. These people are deeply embedded in society, taking advantage of all of the work that millions of other people have done, and are doing.<br/>I have always been a bit of an outsider, occasionally even called a freak, and even on these pages I am often alone as I hold both Republicans and Democrats accountable.<br/>But even a loner like me can understand that alone on an island I would probably not last long.<br/>Sure there are societies that go too far the other way, enforcing stifling rules that discourage creativity and ingenuity, in an extreme attempt to sacrifice all to the greater community.<br/>But the Untied States is not such a place.<br/>Yes, a hundred years ago some Russians thought they could take a short cut to Marx's distant future of a worker governed society by using state power to enforce political conformity. But that totalitarian government was not socialism.<br/>The now 70 year old propaganda trick of saying helping the poor= socialism= communism= totalitarian dictatorship is a big fat lie.<br/>The extreme anti-social ""rugged individualist"" ""greed is good"" agenda is destroying the world. We need a balance between individuals and community. No one on the left is pushing for totalitarianism. But Republicans are trying to divide the while country into unconnected individuals. <br/><br/> INVEST IN HUMANS."
1469,OpEd,Trump is not going to fire Muller. He has said it many times.This is another hysterical side of the left wishing something would happen. The left media brought this up and it is going no where find another bone to chew on.
1470,OpEd,"This is going to get far worse before it gets better.<br/><br/>Like Christof, I expect Trump will try to cut off the Mueller investigation, though--now with Alan Dershowitz' support--he will likely do it by first firing Rosenstein and then installing a shill to direct Mueller to stop work and forego a report. Either way, though, our president--the President of the United States of America--will be flying in the face of the rule of law, the very foundation of our republic.<br/><br/>But while those of us who read the Times are wringing our hands, Fox News' Sean Hannity is doing a show on ""The Mueller Crime Family""--which Trump himself advertised on Twitter.   And InfoWars' Jerome Corsi is advertising his new book--Killing the Deep State:  The Fight to Save President Trump--on national television.  In this latest conspiracy-theory-laden effort (his previous books include ""Where's the Birth Certificate?""), Corsi posits a shadow government plotting to ""take down"" President Trump against the ""will of the people"" and the necessity  of removing the special counsel and dismantling ""corrupt"" agencies like the FBI and the CIA to save Trump from a coup d'etat.  <br/><br/>What is terrifying is that the book is a #1 Best Seller on Amazon, with hundreds of five-star reviews, many calling for ""patriots"" to ""fight to save our Republic.""   And Fox, the most watched news network, is daily blaring the same Deep State message.  When the next shoe drops, Americans may be fighting each other in the streets."

1473,National,I can't believe how this man would want to put his family through a trial!  Why is it that Republicans are so much less up to accepting and to own up to their misbehaviour than Democrats are?  Didn't Al Franken step down because of a silly photograph?

1476,National,"I thought the revelation of this affair in January had cost the Governor his moral authority to lead the state and therefore he should have resigned.  I also wrote my representatives in the state legislature to urge them not to support his continuing in office.  But, I can understand why he has held on.  The behavior occurred before he was Governor, and he has denied any illegal actions.  My hope now is that if convicted at his trial next month he will have the decency to resign before being impeached.  Even he would have to realize at that point that his political career is over for now.  That one of their bright young faces has caused such turmoil is certainly embarrassing for the Republicans, but some of the commenters who are imagining that the party invented sexual scandal certainly have very short memories.  I need only to start with John Conyers, Jr., and Al Franken as the most current additions to a very long list of Democrats to make my point.  "

1499,Sports,"The fact that females brazenly believe that being seen, and wanting to be seen as a sex object, will not be taken in the wrong way, they are wrong,  The fact that the human animal is that, and that sex is the strongest drive there is, should be the first thing that young girls learn, otherwise they naively believe that males have their best interests at heart, not necessarily so.  It is not about going back to being a prude, either, as it is rather being very astute to what you are dealing with in the power of sexuality, and that it does titillate the average female.  Cheerleaders should really be a thing of the past.  The Kardashian sex show has shown what it is, and it has been nothing but a disaster for young females.  They have almost done more harm than has Playboy, in that they know better, and are doing it because of both money, and narcissism.  Let it all end, please, females, don't be a part of this.  Shallow!"
1500,Sports,"Cheerleading seems like an obviously sexist profession, but it's still interesting to learn how that sexism manifests itself. I appreciated the coverage and article with additional evidence of management control. <br/><br/>I'm a bit surprised at the vitriol directed at the women who decide to cheerlead - they might be making the choice to cheerlead, which requires a certain skimpy uniform (much like those of other types of female, and sometimes male, dancers/gymnasts/performers), but that doesn't give their employers or viewers the right to treat them as objects rather than people. Many performers dress even more provocatively and sexualize themselves to an even greater degree than these cheerleaders, yet have the right to push away someone sexually harassing them or reject unwanted advances rather than endure them, especially if they were coming from a ""fan""."
1501,Sports,"I have to agree with a lot of commenters who say isnât there something more important to women employment rights the NYT can report on?  <br/><br/>No one has forced these women into cheerleading. Have a article on strippers lot of women are forced into that by pumps, boyfriends, mafia, sex trade rings. Articles on prostitution where you see desperate women being forced or sometime voluntarily trading their bodies for money. <br/><br/>But cheerleading? These women sign up knowing there is little pay, even smaller outfits and kids of rules. They want to be cheerleaders. I canât feel sorry for women who know what they sign up for complaining when what they signed up for happens. <br/><br/>Can we focus on groups of women that are actually being marginalized or exploited? Tell the cheerleaders go shake their pom poms elsewhere other than the NYT. "
1502,Sports,"These women trade on their sexuality. They signed up to be objects. Quite frankly, the womenâs movement has more important things to do than rescue proverbial arsonists from a house fire. "
1503,Sports,"As a sports fan and one time football fan I loathed and detested the show that took place on the sidelines. As a NY Giants fan I was proud that the team never had them. Sorry ladies I don't think any team actually requires cheerleaders anymore, isn't that the job of the fans? Sorry fellas no more eye candy to distract you."
1504,Sports,All I can think about while reading this is that scene from A Face in the Crowd with Andy Griffith and Lee Remick.  Whatâs more Americana than cheerleading?  We just now noticed whatâs been obvious for years?  What blinders. 
1505,Well,I'm still trying to wrap my mind around most of the comments here which have NOTHING to do with what was being reported. 
1506,Well,"One of the most attractive new buildings in lower downtown Denver is the new DaVita HQ.  The 14 story involvement showcases a suspended ski gondola that doubles as an informal meeting place.  Diabetes is profitable.<br/><br/>The structure was built with low-emitting adhesives, sealants and paints that reduce concentrations of chemical contaminates, resulting in improved indoor air quality and reduced health-related illnesses.  Isn't that special?"
1507,Well,"I recall an interesting article in Scientific American titled ""The Exercise Paradox"". It compared daily caloric expenditure between Hadza men and your average US urban couch potato. While the Hadza  were much more active and ""burned"" more calories each day from activity, their total daily energy expenditure was pretty much the same as the couch potato. What they found was that the Hadza men burned much less at rest (aka resting energy expenditure) , perhaps a compensatory drop to protect from excessive loss of energy. Weight loss is mostly about what we eat though for total health, motion is the lotion!"
1508,Well,"Diet and exercise--by diet I mean eating sensibly, to cease eating when<br/>your body tells you to. Exercise regularly, but also walk stairs and escalators, stand instead of sit, park as far as possible from store/mall, etc.<br/><br/>I am 73, 30W, 30L Levis since the 1970s. Gain 25lbs between high school graduation and PhD. degree. Lost those pounds at age 29 and remained fit and slim ever since. My advice above works. (In addition to running 30-40 miles per week, I walk, hike mountain trails, play squash, etc.)<br/><br/>Develop and practice fitness/dietary habits. You will succeed. But, most<br/>importantly, you must want to succeed. You must eliminate habits that work against this lifestyle.  The rewards are worth it. Not merely improved fitness,<br/>improved health, sound sleep, and a better attitude towards living."
1509,Well,"""They don't mention kayak trips and rock climbing experiences, they tell you how great the restaurants were.""<br/><br/>There are plenty of physical activities besides kayak trips &amp; rock climbing that people can enjoy when traveling.   Hiking, walking for long periods of time, swimming . . . And you can enjoy what you eat w/out eating huge quantities, when you travel, when you're at home.<br/><br/>What would be helpful in the US would be making walking during the course of a day alot easier.   Most of the transport infrastructure $$ are still spent on supporting personal motor vehicle use.  Where I live, the town is happy to buy land for a parking lot, and puts one small unsheltered (rains alot here for part of the year), as far away from the city workplaces as possible.  Few sidewalks, no effort to encourage city employees to walk or use mass transit to get to work (see parking lot).  Same thing at any new beach access (I live on a coast), parking lot enlarged, repaved, repainted, a new restroom and . . . it took a major effort to get one small bike rack installed.   The PW director refused to put in a short sidewalk (30') to connect the parking lot w/a traffic light w/access pads (ADA access), which would make it a little safer to get to a nearby bus stop.   There's a bike lane maybe 20' from the parking lot--but the PW director apparently believed that no cyclist would ever want to use the brand new restrooms or the beach access.<br/>    That's typical of most of the US.   "
1510,Well,"This was a ""proof of concept"" study to use the new tracking technology to observe the mice and see if their behavior could be followed. The software routines associated with this technology also had to be developed and validated. Obese mice were not used in this study because that would add an extra variable when the real goal was the development and validation of the technology. Whenever a new technology platfrom is introduced in a field, these types of studies are necessary to work out the kinks, introduce it to others working in the field and get feedback. This allows the technology to be vetted by others in the field so that it is accepted as valid when it is used in more complex studies."

1513,Well,"Please note, that this phenomenon is culture specific, and doesnt occur in this form in most of the world, but mostly in western middle class environments. This article generalized and normalizes an allergy, clearly a symptom of a health problem, and tells us to live with it.

And why would an emotionally healthy young person want to hurt their well-meaning parents over something like the style of their shoes? Perspective is everything."
1514,Well,"Great article!  My montra is ""we give them life, we are not there life"". This phase of parenting, I find to be the most challenging.

1515,Well,"Fine, but you must be aware that most families do not enjoy this level of privilege. Many families struggle to meet the minimum daily requirement of simply appearing to be normal. Great numbers of parents are so stressed they can barely house, dress, and feed their kids, forget about shared positive experiences or support."
1516,OpEd,"Kudos for this article. I totally identify with the author. I was lucky in that my mom was raised in a time when good penmanship was highly valued and taught at school, so she made me take calligraphy classes when I was a teen. I learned to write and sign my name in full, in a clear and elegant cursive.  Few people can say the same.  I don't sign credit cards or checks anymore, but I do write special messages to my students and inscriptions on books, nicely signed.

1522,Magazine,"I wish I could find it, but there was an article not that long ago that discussed the difference between American doctors and European doctors when it came to diagnosing pre-eclampsia early and that American doctors were just not great at it. It also talked about how providers in California were making great strides and were lowering the mortality rates around this particular condition.  And I'm not sure that mentioning Medicaid in the article is relevant because rationed health care in Europe hasn't delivered the same results and there have been studies that show Hispanic women have similar infant mortality rates as White women despite receiving less health care than most African- American women. It would seem that stress is really the main factor here. "
1523,Magazine,"This is caused nearly entirely by the Great Society of Lyndon Johnson, which destroyed the potential for these people to form families.  Ronald Reagan hit the nail on the head.  Personal responsibility.  Family.  Mothers with husbands who are dads to their children, not bearing the children of  sperm donors.  This didn't have to be.  It was created by the left.  It will take a long long time to cure these problems, for they will not be cured by money.  You can throw an unlimited sum at irresponsible people, and they will squander the money.  There is no amount of money that would cure these problems, for the more money you throw at this problem, the worse it will get.  It's the behavior, not the money. "
1524,Magazine,"Terms such as ""institutional and structural"" racism are relative vague terms. What specifically does this mean and how specifically does this ""racism"" cause the deaths of black babies? Anecdotal snippets such as ""A medical resident, who was white, like all of the staff who would attend Landrum throughout her labor and delivery, walked into the room with paperwork. Right away, she asked Landrum briskly, âHave you had any children before?â mean nothing concerning specifics related to black baby deaths. Perhaps the medical resident, who happens to be white, had been working 24-hours or longer as many residents do, perhaps this person's personality is like this with all people regardless of color etc. This article uses anecdotal stories/opinions to make the argument that racism is the end-all cause for the higher rate of black infant mortality. Perhaps this is accurate, but for me, I'm not relying on anecdotal evidence as the end-all explanation, as the VERY vague term ""racism,"" I believe, is way too often used to explain problems in our society for all non-whites, and especially in the African American community. "
1525,Magazine,"Where is the assessment of the effect of multiple partners which may be indicative of dangerous or poor choices which increase the risk factors? Perhaps having multiple partners and going back to abusive men contributed to the tragic events. History has shown that a lack of moral choices frequently results in horrible consequences.<br/><br/>If we are to believe that racism is the primary culprit can we learn what the race of Ms. Williams doctor was? If it was an African American doctor are we to believe that the doctor was either ignorant or racist as well? <br/><br/>How about we consider that there are some genetic differences which predispose or increase the probability that a particular individual suffer from certain diseases. Native Americans were susceptible to diseases brought by Europeans. However, it is not fair to say that Europeans tried to exterminate the Native Americans by utilization of their immunities."
1526,Magazine,"Strange that all the stress and racism etc. does not affect African-American women disporoportionally n their social mobility and employment lives.

1528,Magazine,Many comments about HER and her (poor) choices to have children without support systems or education. WAIT - it takes two to make a baby.

1529,Magazine,"I have spent 40 years in the nursing profession, as both an RN and a Nurse Practitioner. Many MDs and nurses should have become auto mechanics instead of doctors; they simply do not have the empathy that their position requires. Their actions become robotic and dictated by algorithms. As medicine (and nursing) becomes increasingly specialized, electronic, remote and profit-driven I believe the racism and sexism that supports this poor excuse of âcareâ will continue to be entrenched. "
1530,Magazine,"Ms. Landrum's life is a mess. Most of her problems are self-induced, including her poor choice in men. Ms. Landrum and others similarly situated have to have some self discipline and avoid the damaging personal relationships that are responsible for their predicament. It is not her race, or Hurricane Katrina or the fact that she lives in New Orleans. The majority of Americans know it is the result of decisions made by Ms. Landrum; possibly on impulse, to engage in dangerous behavior with predatory men. <br/><br/>The argument made in this article is that under-class women need a life coach because they are unable to lead normal productive lives without constant guidance. "
1531,Magazine,"As a retired Women's Health Care nurse practitioner,I found this article to be an excellent piece of journalism, as well as deeply disturbing. While some of the reader comments are correct, in that we are not told the medical professionals' points of view, and that there is a responsibility that the patient must take in their care, overall, I would have to agree with the writer; there is an appalling discrepancy in health care based on race in our country. My entire career was focused on underrepresented individuals in inner-city teaching hospitals. The stresses that my patients lived with were unimaginable, and I don't think I would have been able to cope nearly as well as most of them did, were I in a similar situation. Nor are these problems that can be solved in 1 or even 2 generations. I have observed countless times the scenario of doctors, be they residents or attending physicians, not making any attempt to connect to their patients. I have also observed the amazing role of doulas, as well as innovative ways to deliver care, such as the Centering Pregnancy model."
1532,Magazine,"I want to thank the author for bringing attention to the disparity between whites and blacks - it's something I was not aware of. It saddened me deeply to read the article; knowing the numbers of women in America who are facing many of the same problems Ms. Landrum experienced. I only hope we can somehow bridge the gap that exists, and make medical access and care equal for all. "
1533,Magazine,"Yes, Iâm sure a dedicated father figure would have had a significant impact on the systemic racism that causes weathering and leads to negative outcomes with black women and their babies as compared to white women. And a dedicated father figure would have made the way the young mother was treated at the hospital with her last two pregnancies different. They probably would have treated her like a professor. I mean, a white professor."
1534,Magazine,"You're correct: it is absolutely sickening. <br/><br/>I am a white woman who formerly worked at Planned Parenthood. Many white women are on your side, but so many MORE need to learn about the racial disparities that negatively affect prenatal care and birth outcomes for Women of Color.<br/><br/>Too many White people who could help solve these inequities are cloistered in their gated communities. They need to know what the problems are. How do we force their eyes open? That is the million-dollar question. "
1535,Magazine,"Clearly the goal should be to have conversations about contraception as part of postnatal care proceeding the first pregnancy.   Ideally, they should take place before a first unplanned pregnancy, but it is not realistic to assume that every unplanned pregnancy will be prevented (especially in today's Red controlled congress).  Thus, providers should use other healthcare encounters, especially postnatal care, as a chance to provide contraceptive counseling.    Also, I disagree with your comments that suggest it is too late for these conversations to make a difference.  There is a difference between 3 children and 4+ children."

Certain aspects of treatment of women in my family by a major hospital in this city and by doctors, relevant to pregnancy, including a discharge with a life-threatening condition, have been very bad.  Those women are white.  When my sister and I visited our mother in the hospital--not in New Orleans, but not far away--we got the same eye-rolling (""You ask a lot of questions"") that Landrum met with from the nurse.  We are white.  So yes, dismissive or worse treatment may well be a result of racist attitudes, but whites get it too.  I don't know how, absent some explicit remark, anybody would know in a particular case whether it is the effect of pervasive racism or not."
1546,Magazine,"Yes, and they're also ignoring that for African American women, waiting to have children can result in worse health outcomes.  They ignore that many teen moms were impregnated by adult men.  They ignore that many black American women have few to no prospects for marriage, unless they are in certain lucky categories. They also ignore that Serena Williams had a pulmonary embolism in the past, and yet as a rich, famous athlete who has to know her body extremely well, she almost died. The realities of weathering is confirmed in people's responses to this article. "
1547,Magazine,"That's the irony, isn't it? One of the key findings in this article is that black women are routinely disregarded or ignored, even when they are giving the only accurate information regarding the symptoms of their health. <br/><br/>The disregard of that information has led to the disastrous health outcomes outlined in the statistics of this article. <br/><br/>And yet the comments regarding this article that disregard the clear, scientifically and empirically grounded evidence that racism is the significant driving factor behind this national disgrace seem to validate the author's point: black women and their plight are ignored, disregarded, and rationalized away, and it's often because we, as a nation, do not really consider blacks and Latinos fully human, and therefore worthy of our empathy. <br/><br/>And at the same time it is our own lack of human qualities that shows through, not theirs."

1549,Arts&Leisure,"My wife and I enjoyed Condola Rashad's performance along with the entire cast of ""Saint Joan.""  We were among many at the end of the play who gave the entire cast a 'standing ovation.'  Why writers/critics like you bring to the surface a black actress playing a white character continues to be annoying when there's  much political division in our nation - that includes a history of race tensions.  <br/><br/>Cannot an actress or actor be evaluated for their performance and not have their race mentioned as an issue as you have highlighted?<br/><br/>Even the title of your article ""Joan of Arc, Superstar? Not to the Woman Playing Her,""  seems out of place for the interview you did with Ms. Rashad."
1550,Arts&Leisure,Here's a question for everybody:  Can Othello be played by a White actor?
1551,Arts&Leisure,"Unless white actors can portray Dr. Martin Luther King, the casting of a black Joan of Arc - no matter how gifted the actress is - is political correctness run amok. Which only serves to empower Donald Trump.<br/><br/>Demonizing white actors for cultural appropriation, while black actors get standing ovations for playing white people, is the definition of hypocrisy. "
1552,Arts&Leisure,"It's hard to understand how charges of cultural appropriation brought by French ultranationalists and others, probably because Condola Rashad is not white, make any sense other than as racist rants since she is acting in a play written in English by George Bernard Shaw, an Irishman."
1553,Arts&Leisure,Cultural appropriation?? I'm not even sure how that term acutally applies...
1554,Arts&Leisure,"Ms. Rashad earned my standing ovation for dismissing the ""cultural appropriation"" charge.  It must always be dismissed. Our lives are enriched beyond measure when we inhabit the world of ""the other.""  Although commercial imperatives prohibit this experiment on professional stages, I would gladly teach black plays (plays written by blacks for black actors) with whites in each role. Imagine what could be understood, comprehended by a white actor as Lena Younger in ""A Raisin in the Sun,"" or as Troy Maxson in ""Fences.""  Back in the days of racial segregation, black casts routinely performed the great theater classics -- Shakespeare, Ibsen, Chekov, Miller, Williams, O'Neill and Albee.  We were cast in each role with nary a thought to why or how could this be.  It was.  And it was creativity and imagination and high art that transcended pedestrian realities.  And glory be, the discovery was made that fundamental human complexity knows no color boundaries.  See the jaw-dropping work of Anna Deavere Smith for powerful and brilliant lessons that ""cultural appropriation"" must have no quarter in our lives, and certainly not in the theater."
1555,Arts&Leisure,Totally agree!  This is what great theater is all about. Saw this production and the cast is amazingly.  Catch it now.

1558,Arts&Leisure,"Kenny Adams, Joan of Arc was born and raised in a small village in rural France in the early 15th Century.  Dozens of people who had known her personally testified about her at her posthumous retrial that overturned her conviction for heresy.  If she had been anything other than standard European White, which would have been considered extraordinary, people would have said so at that time.  Nowhere, in hundreds of pages of eyewitness trial testimony about her, pages which are intact in the archives of France today, is there the least suggestion that she was anything other than White.  Shakespeare tried to demonize her for his English audiences by describing her as ""dark and swart,"" but that's just Shakespeare pandering to his English audience that hated her at a time and place when ""dark and swart"" was an insult.  The chances of Joan having any African blood in her are nil.  I know more about Joan than most people.  I wrote my Master's Thesis about her.  My thesis is now a full length scholarly book that has received positive peer reviews."
1559,Arts&Leisure,"@Kenny Adams and others:<br/>Good grief!  There are and were plenty of people of color in France.  Just to cite famous ones, there was Empress Josephine (you know Napoleon's first wife) and of course Alexandre Dumas, the son of the Napoleon who was nicknamed ""the black colonel"".  And then many more then and now....<br/><br/>Incidentally some famous black persons in Western cultural history include Beethoven and Pushkin.  Melanin only became a big thing when it was needed to justify slavery.  Prior to this justification there were (sadly) white slaves in Europe..<br/><br/>I've read accounts of survivors in small villages in what is now Southern France.  The hue of locals and invaders seemed totally irrelevant, as if commenting on someone's hair or eye color.   <br/><br/>In Medieval times and afterwards, what mattered was whether you had a free status of were a serf.  Actually accusation of having had a serf in your genealogy caused a civil was in Northern France.  Racism is historically linked to previous ""one drop rule"" associated with social status....  it seems that skin color (real or imagined) somehow came to fit in the mold already elaborated to justify serfdom....

1565,Investigative,I'll be amazed if Cohen escapes being disbarred
1566,Investigative,Were Trump and the Trump Organization the only clients of Cohen? It would open a new can of worms. There should be a reason for Trump to lamented that the FBI raids was similar as an attack on his country.<br/>Let's hope that Special Counsel Mueller team will look closely to this matter.
1567,Investigative,"As a retired Attorney, I want Cohen disbarred.  He actions to shield Trump were, at least grossly unethical and probably illegal.  If what Trump claims is even remotely accurate, Cohen, without consulting his client and using his own money tried to bribe Stormy Daniels.  Ot, Cohen had trump's blessings and money but is now lying about it. If I did that for a client and were caught, I'd lose my license to practice law.  "
1568,Investigative,"Paul Ryan and Hope Hicks both jumped ship in advance of this raid which does not bode well for our previously-teflon President. I have a feeling that what the lawyers found in that office will stick to Trump and his house will crumble. The forensic investigators are poring over the files now, watch for indictments this summer, and I think it will not be a pretty picture. Mr. Trump plays hardball and it is about to be exposed, this is why he is so angry."
1569,Investigative,"Cohen brought his troubles on himself. The heavy-handed, surprise raid of Cohen's office had to happen because there was no doubt that he would have destroyed whatever evidence he had that pointed to Trump. It's well known that Cohen is sleazy, so the prosecutor had no choice to act as he did. Cohen's willingness to be Trump's lapdog, his well-established lack of ethics and integrity and the zeal with which he devoted his career to a scumbag real estate developer are what brought him down. "
1570,Investigative,"The FBI had to raid Cohen in the manner that they did as they know he will not give up anything damaging to Trump freely. Cohen also knows that as long as Trump is president that there's always the option of a pardon if he does get into any legal jeopardy, unless of course it can be shown that both he and Trump were partners to these crimes. The net is closing in on Trump and even if he gets rid of Mueller this investigation as too much momentum to just go away. "
1571,Investigative,"Just a reminder to those who are impatient with Mueller, the Watergate investigation took a full two years to investigate fully. The Russia investigation is much larger and infinitely more important---and we are just over a year since Mueller came on the scene.  He's clearly rolling up the little people making his way to the big fish.  It's hard not to see this all points to Trump.  I wouldn't be surprised if you was guilty on all charges---conspiracy, obstruction, and money laundering. "
1572,Investigative,Maybe he can arrange someting with Mueller.

1574,Investigative,"Presumably they can.  If the police search your car for drugs, and in doing so they find an unregistered gun, they can charge you with the gun offence.  The investigators can't search beyond what the warrant specifies, but I believe they can use any evidence they find during the search."
1575,Investigative,I agree that anything is possible in Washington but it seems like this is a New York case now and I do not think Trump has many friends in that city.

How could The Times have failed to expose the corruption and criminal related activities as someone the paper knew so well ran for President? You easily uncovered the danger of Hillary Clintonâs email server, taking her to task for it repeatedly. You gave extensive coverage to the October Comey letter. And later the Times exposed Harvey Weinsteinâs war against women. But in your own backyard you wrote a major Magazine piece evenhandedly reporting Trumpâs treatment of women at work, while failing to follow up on 18 sexual harassment accusations. No in-depth expose of his business dealings. No coverage of the fraud his children perpetrated to sell Trump Soho. And, finally, the inaccurate exoneration by the FBI regarding Russian collusion. No one knew Donald Trump better and warned the voting public less."
1582,Editorial,"The law seems to apply only to republicans. Bill and Hillary have done WAY MORE bad stuff than Trump. The Clintons actually used their influence for PERSONAL gain at the EXPENSE of our nation. They have broken numerous laws with impunity and the NY TIMES has never called them out (like they are trying to do to Trump right now). Trumps ""crimes"" are silly and unimportant as compared to the HUGE and UGLY crimes of the Clintons (and senior DOJ staff). Trying to take down a president by using dumb bank fraud charges is repulsive. And anyway, you can use a HELOC for anything you want. It has no restrictions, so this is NOT bank fraud. "
1583,Editorial,"   Bravo to the NYT's editorial board.  Beautiful summary on the crook we have in the White House. This nation is enduring the results of the only successful rigged election in its history.<br/>  We initially thought that Russia hacked into our election--remember the hacked changes to voter registration data that stopped voters from voting.  Now we learn that one of Trump's rich supporters used his company to manipulate stolen Facebook data to create ""fake news"" to sway voters to Trump.<br/>      September 2011 was only a physical attack on our nation.  The bogus election results of 2016 was a moral attack on our nation's soul.<br/>   This 2016 attack continues today with the GOP congress and Trump attempting to turn our democracy into an authoritarian government. Where is the leadership in this country to tell to our citizens what is happening to our nation?<br/>The NYT's excellent editorial is an honest start.  However, we need someone from the GOP with stature such as John McCain or Mitt Romney  or Mitch McConnell to honestly explain to the American people what has occurred and is still underway  to undermine our democracy.  (Of course GOP Senate leader Mitch McConnell would never put our country before the GOP party--how naive of me).<br/>ps--NYTs you can leave out the last sentence in ( ) if it is too political for you"

"
1588,Editorial,"We non-Americans are looking on in horrid fascination. Then again, Italy had Berlusconi, who like an un-dead zombie is now back, age 103 or so, to adulation from most Italians. So Trump is not unique. It's just that we thought higher of you than to elect someone everyone knew well in advance is a crook to the most powerful job on this planet. it simply beggars belief.

The law absolutely should be coming for Trump, and not a minute too soon. America may not be perfect, but I'm betting we'll listen to our better angels when it comes to the final dispensation of the Trump travesty."
1592,Editorial,"No Mr. Trump...America was not attacked on the day your lawyer's office was raided. America was defended on that day.<br/><br/>The true ""disgrace"" was not the raid itself.

1597,Editorial,"The NYTâs attempt to impeach the President during the election, prior to his inauguration and after he took office is as worthy of disgust as the company Trump keeps.  Like it or not, DJT, not the newspapers, was elected President of the country.  There has never been any attempt by the press in this country to let him govern."
1598,Editorial,"Is there a way to start holding Fox News more accountable for the stunning cultural and political divide they have so carefully fostered over the last 20 years? We have Freedom of the Press - but they are not the Press, and have never been. They are ""entertainment, and a commercially sponsored propaganda branch of the Far Right - which has gone from Conservative, to Far Right, to Alt Right... to outright Treasonous. Is there any one single force in Society, in the Public space, in the realm of Public Discourse that has fostered so much rage, hype, civic mistrust of government institutions, and   open hatred of any Leaders or Citizens who do not hold the the views of their Tribe?<br/><br/>Our deluded President watches Fox News - rather than taking (and believing) regular government and intelligence briefings. He doesn't do his job, but instead watches for 8-9 hours a day(!) Fox News pretty much openly tells him what to think, what to believe, and who to trust (them). Millions watch daily for their dose of rage and distorted world views. Everyday, the gulf between the Fact Based and the Fox Based widens.  What do we have that will pull our nation together? How do we repair the damage? How do we stop the daily dose of poison dropped into the village well?<br/><br/>It's going to take decades to undo the damage - even if Fox News were to end tomorrow.  They helped get this terrible President elected... and they daily urge him towards the reckless, and even the indefensible. Enough already!"

That was useful advice that I passed on to my daughters and it seems relevant to this editorial.<br/><br/>Donald has never taken himself out of the frame. He even has gone to the extent of falsely framing himself  by photoshopping his image on a bogus Time magazine cover.  I suspect what he is experiencing these days is unlike anything else in his lifetime. It is deeply unfortunate we need to bear witness (and possibly be victims) to that. 
1602,Editorial,"I would be curious to hear from the President's supporters.  Are they not the least embarrassed for him?  Whining that it's all so ""unfair"" seems so unpresidential, so puerile and pathetic; equating personal legal problems (very much of his own making) with an attack on the United States?  It's just shameless and sad."

1606,Editorial,"What makes this so difficult is that this is NOT suppose to happen in America, and why we have three branches of government, all equal entities.  Here is a man who's track record of dishonesty arrives before he does and who has never met ""good character"".  Yet, here he is basically threatening to throw the rule of law under the bus for his own personal self serving reason to avoid scrutiny and accountability.  What safeguards are there in place for this?  NONE.  Congress has willingly allowed this man to remove their sworn duty and responsibility to hold him accountable.  They have allowed themselves to be relegated to being a rubber stamp and useless body of government.  How much more different is he from Maduro of Venezuela, or Kim Jong Un of North Korea, or Putin of Russia?  Not very much.  As long as he hears nothing but silence from this GOP Congress, he will become more and more brazen.  It is great to live in a democracy, where freedom of speech and freedom of our press thrives.  Yet today, those two fundamental and core rights are threaten by a man who is so drunk with power and who is mentally, intellectually, and morally unfit and corrupted.  This is indeed the worst threat to America today.  We cannot let this happen by allowing this man to remain in power. Too many lives were sacrificed to protect our dear America since the birth of our nation to now allow a this madman to destroy it now.  Not now, not ever."

As someone who grew up in Trump's 80's tabloid heyday in NY, I can honestly, such a piece of advice is completely beyond him.<br/><br/>But I would argue, this is almost a test for us old East Coasters. Anyone who grew up in the tabloid era should know,l something has always been wrong with this boy.<br/><br/>And we almost died when the rest of the country did not listen to us. Maybe they will listen to us now. Trump is and always has been a warped and kind of pathetic person. <br/><br/>The fact he got elected is a clarion call that our system -- Republican and Democrat -- needs to do some serious repair work on how our presidential system works.

He is on record as planning on ramping up their nuclear arsenal when the agreement expires and has committed Iran to the completion of the genocide of the Jews ( his words not mine).<br/>5) NATO must begin to re0organize it'sd defenses both against the direction that Turkey is heading and the clear ability of Russia to effectively use jamming to neutralize NATO power.<br/>6) Sanctions don't work against Russia.

There are many vital products that are today only made in China.  I've read that power transformers essential to our electrical grid are one example.  Electronics, critical to just about everything, are becoming another.  Remember where your iPhone is manufactured.<br/><br/>Further, China does not play on a level field.  China requires that American companies that wish to do business in China ""partner"" with a Chinese company.  The allows the Chinese firm to expropriate the American company's intellectual property and expertise.<br/><br/>Both sides would benefit from from free trade.  But it has to be fair trade, and America must maintain manufacturing capability; our very existence depends on it.  We won two world wars because we could build things.<br/><br/>We are in our current predicament because of the policies of multiple previous administrations, including that of President Obama.

These people who follow him obsessively are being fed an alternate reality by Fox and Breitbart and other similar sources. I can't shake off the fear that we are living in two Americas, and what that means for the stability of our country further down the road. This chasm between what's real and what's perceived is illustrated in a conversation I had with in-laws who are Fox supporters. They claim that everyone in the press lies and you can't trust anything the press says.<br/><br/>I'm reminded of a story I was told of a child, of how students in classrooms in my native Cuba were shown pictures of Americans standing in breadlines, the point being that what they'd heard about American abundance was all propaganda and lies. Here were Americans begging for food. And the pictures being used? Cleverly edited pictures of Americans standing in line for tickets at a movie theater.    "
1635,Washington,"Trump in a compulsive Pathological lier......he has no conscience for what he does and says.....you can see that in his face when he goes on his rants. I can still hear Trump's crude remarks towards women on the Billy Bush ""Plant Hollywood"" interview where Trump is bragging that he is a star and can just crab women's personal body parts where and when ever he pleases and get away with it (not to mention he was married at the time too).

1640,Dining,"As a picky picky organic baker I was thrilled to have two wonderful fresh deserts at COASTAL MIST CHOCOLATE BOUTIQUE  in Bandon, Oregon. Baked daily and perfect."
1641,Dining,"I love a good sundae, but the ice cream must be of good quality (high cream content...i.e., very dense like a gelato) and the fudge sauce must also be very rich (not thin or made with corn syrup...but very rich and made with actual chocolate and heavy cream and vanilla...).  Otherwise, the sundae is pointless imho."
1642,Dining,All I can think of when reading this article is Jahn's in Brooklyn in the 60's and the Kitchen Sink I never ordered. 
1643,Dining,"As if to show the contrast to the overused nostalgia of the Sundae, the link to the Dan Hicks song was a perfect example of ideal nostalgia. The song reminded me I love Dan Hicks, and I do miss him, and am sad he went away. But the huge smile his music always induces will be there forever. Thanks Dan!"
1644,Dining,"Yesterday  I went to a restaurant with fancy desserts and my niece ordered the most expensive dessert of the menu, the Chocolate Terrarium. She loves chocolate and sundaes.  It arrived true to its name in a terrarium and looked like, well, dirty moss in a terrarium.  I am sure some dessert impresario reigned over its production, but my niece turned her nose up and most of it went into the composter.  Sometimes a sundae is a very good idea.  "
1645,Dining,the best hot fudge sunday is at Hillstones
1646,Dining,"The deemphasis of desserts by restaurants is unsurprising given the short shrift this newspaper gives them in its reviews, almost always an afterthought. The critic created the problem he now complains about."
1647,Dining,Restaurants serve sundaes because they're simple and good and people order them. Who really wants a poached whole navel orange?
1648,Dining,Pete Wells thanks for your honesty.<br/>Keep it up.
1649,Dining,"âbut they can now pay you $30,000 or $40,000 less a year because youâre not a chef, youâre not in charge.â<br/><br/>Many teachers are paid only $30,000 or $40,000 per year total.  And, increasingly, like these chefs, they are not in charge.  What does it mean when we pay people more to scoop ice cream than to teach our kids ? "
1650,Dining,"Above all, Pete seems to have had his fill of the dreaded  Jaded Sundae. It<br/>simply tastes too good and induces a debilitating case of brain feeeze, causing one to complain about irrelevant things. "
1651,Dining,Iâd eat them all.
1652,Dining,"I had no idea this ice cream sundae trend was happening. I live mostly overseas, in South Africa at present (lots of malva pudding!), but I do visit New York occasionally and travel a lot. I agree with others and Pete Wells that when I do indulge in dessert at a restaurant I want something that is not what I could just pull out of the freezer. It is rather shameful. Do they think no one would notice the lack of imagination? I also read once that dessert for a restaurant is a money maker since they can charge rather high prices for a slice of tart, let's say. I always thought that places without a pastry chef just outsourced dessert to a bakery as I do. My mother always said she never made what others could do better and she was a cook but not a baker. "
1653,Dining,The title suggested an eat healthy imperative rather than a finessing of ultra high calorie food. How many people of any age these days look like they should eat a sundae?<br/>Why not contribute to customers' well being by offering them a complimentary apple at meal's end?<br/>I suspect there may not be a uniformly positive response here.
1654,Dining,"Kudos to Pete Wells for this well-researched article on the restaurant business that highlighted the economic reality behind ice cream sundaes.<br/>I now understand why so many Americans and particularly New Yorkers flock to Paris for an alternative dessert experience. Many of the so-called chefs in Paris have mastered simple pastry desserts or buy them from a respected source just as they do their bread. Ice cream sundaes are not on the menu. These are simple bistro or cafe restaurants with affordable dining which is why they are always packed.<br/>As for the restaurants with pastry chefs and sous-chefs, many of these desserts sell for 12 to 30â¬ or more. And people expect to be surprised. And they usually are. They understand that by paying a lot more for a dessert experience, they are entitled to get one.<br/>I hope Pete Wells will write more articles on the economics of dining out. This type of reporting is both intelligent and enlightening. Restaurants where we go to ârestoreâ ourselves should be better understood by the public who go there."
1655,Dining,"We are partial to a bowl of fresh fruit drizzled with something like a brand or orange liquor. Simple, healthful."
1656,Dining,"It really ticks me off when the only available dessert options involve ice cream. Have the proprietors considered that a fair number of people can't eat it? Offer something--anything--else in addition. It's a bit boring and not my thing, but surely sorbet isn't any more trouble than ice cream."
1657,Dining,"The best sundae I ever had after a meal was from Friendly's. When I was a child my best friend and I would walk to town and order a hamburger on toast and a toasted almond sundae. Heaven. I can't even imagine having a sundae after a meal now, isn't a sundae a meal in and of itself?<br/>Here in New Orleans desert is an art form. Sundaes may be on the menu but I've never noticed, I don't get past the creme brÃ»lÃ©e. Now fresh profiteroles stuffed with ice-cream and drizzled with chocolate maybe..."
1658,Dining,Lots of substandard pastries.. not sure why.. too expensive by half.. and I love Greek rice pudding.. or Spanish...<br/><br/>CafÃ© affogato -- is often the perfect dessert.  best with both vanilla ice cream and plain whipped cream  and left-over breakfast coffee.<br/>Real sour cherry pie: that odd strawberry pie with the red guck over the fresh strawberries: anything pavlova (meringue preferably with pecans in it and with strawberries and crÃ¨me Chantilly (Trader Joes has whipping cream that can stay on the shelf forever. ) The Brits do well on many sweets.. France and Italy now mixed. Maybe Starbucks should bring back sofgliatella.  
1659,Dining,"Years ago while traveling in Spain, my husband and I met a couple who were both cardiologists.  They said that once a week they ate only desert for dinner.  Their chosen treat: rhubarb clafouti.  The we got back to to Seattle I found a recipe in a Sunset Cookbook and tried it.  Definitely worth giving up lots of anything to eat it!!!   Yummy."
1660,Dining,"Il Palio in Chapel Hill, North Carolina served me the best dessert I ever had. A three tiered plate of beautiful to look at and delicious to taste cookies. Yes, cookies. Just enough sweetness after a sumptuous meal to have with a coffee or the rest of the wine and they boxed up the rest for us to take home. Why canât all restaurants serve a little plate of cookies to finish off a wonderful meal? It was just right!"
1661,Dining,"Agreed.  The ice cream sundae must be stopped. It cannot be the only offering on a restaurantâs dessert menu. Pete points to Is the real issue being one of food costs and skilled labor.  Add to that a paucity of imagination. Chez Panisse is known for perfect fruit in season, tangerines with fresh dates. Cheers to Prune for being equally creative. "
1662,Dining,I love ice cream and I love pie.<br/>When I don't know which one to pick I pick both.<br/>(don't tell my doctor.)<br/>I like a combination of vanilla and mocha and some nuts and some rum to give it a little kick with a side dish of hot apple pie and whip cream.<br/>I don't like the ice cream  on top of the pie as the temperature of the pie cools down when you do that.<br/>I don't want syrup as that takes away from the ice cream flavor.<br/>If I want syrup which I do sometime I put it on some whip cream not ice cream.
1663,Dining,Would love a recipe for that navel orange!
1664,Dining,"Or - OR! - Every place has ice cream because everyone wants it, because it's delicious, classic, and for many, the perfect end to a meal.  As the article admits, it can be the perfect canvas for creative chefs as well. If only serving ice cream with no other offerings, I get it -- the problem there is a lack of dessert options in general, not the presence of ice cream.  This was much ado about nothing."
1665,Dining,"<br/>I know plenty of outstanding bakers who are not pastry chefs.  Every item they create is delicious and noteworthy primarily due to real ingredients, i.e., butter, cream, eggs, chocolate, etc.  Nothing used is artificial.  Their desserts are items folks crave:  carrot cake, decadent chocolate cake, apple pie, just for starters.<br/><br/>I never understood why restaurants donât hire people just to make a finite selection of daily desserts.  Heck, my mother used to do that for one of the local restaurants in my home town.  But then, I think people came to the joint just for her desserts.  <br/><br/>I guess fancy NYC restaurants canât get away with that idea but how is serving ice cream ANYTHING even an option?  When Jen Yee, executive pastry chef of Resurgens Hospitality Group stated ice cream â holds well, it doesnât really get oldâ I thought, man, she got that wrong.  Ice cream DOES get old if it sits in the freezer for long periods of time after it has been opened.  Itâs called freezer burn.  On a few occasions I have been served old ice cream and it tasted almost musty.  There is only so much one can do to gussy up a scoop or two of ice cream.  Itâs the various sauces, candies, and other peculiarities the kitchen staff will use to make a bowl of hum drum ice cream look more fancy and special than it really is.<br/><br/>If I want an honest to goodness outstanding and delicious sundae, I can make it at home with real ingredients.  Why would I ever consider ordering that from ANY restaurant?"
1666,Dining,I check the dessert menu before deciding on whether to order an appetizer.  I'll even order the dessert when I order dinner to make sure it's not sold out by the time I'm done my entrÃ©e.  I've got my priorities straight!
1667,Dining,Spot on. This is why I read the times!
1668,Dining,Last dish of a healthy diet should be seasonal fruits ; America the obese !
1669,Dining,"When I was a boy 50+ years ago the only place I got ice cream was at the candy store which was hand scooped Breyers cones, Shoemachers Ice Cream Parlor and the Chinese restaurant. Only Shoemachers made sundaes. Other than that it was a piece of cake chocolate preferred.<br/>For a real treat we'd go out to Queens to Jahn's. We had 10 people in my family and The Kitchen Sink was the most economical offering. It came in metal cup the size of a soup tureen filled with bananas, ice cream in various flavors, nuts and seemingly every thing in the kitchen.<br/>I like my ice cream boring. Neapolitan, butter pecan. Skip the sauces but once in a while fresh fruit like sliced peaches can be enjoyable (not canned) and especially good with vanilla.<br/>Ice cream is good enough in its natural state and doesn't really need embellishments. And if you are going to have ice cream buy only the ones with the largest fat content. No sense wasting the calories on the cheap stuff."
1670,Dining,One in ten order dessert since all they have to offer is the ice cream I have at home.
1671,Dining,I prefer creme brÃ»lÃ©e. Canât have caffeine after 3 pm anymore or Iâm up all night. Creme brÃ»lÃ©e doesnât keep me awake.
1672,Dining,White chocolate bread pudding at Bayona . . . 
1673,Dining,"Thanks for mentioning Sanders. Here in Detroit, it's a legend and the place<br/> to go for a delicious hot fudge sundae. A close second is any ice cream or gelato made by American Spoon Foods in Petosky."
1674,Dining,"I get a fairly decent strudel at Aldi's. It's a German company with a complement of the most purchased items but it also has a large number of German import items at prices lower than the US brands. They also have a large selection of Stollen particularly at Christmas time. Another place here is also a German company, Lidl. Both chains are popular in Europe.<br/>The funniest thing about them is that you can also buy a lawnmower and other items you don't expect to find in a food store. "
1675,Dining,"If restaurants didn't serve entrÃ©es that would provide a meal for two, or even three, people, more of us would have room for dessert!   "

1679,Science,"This debate fails to consider the spirit. Science and the soul are not mutually exclusive. While porn might temporarily provide pleasure for us physically, perhaps emotionally too, it does not ""feed the soul"". Art however, plays a definitive role in the redemption of the world - in making the world more loving, peaceful and harmonious.  Yes, art can do all that. Candy cannot. Why do scientists fear the human heart and soul? Is ""lack"" of empirical proof enough evidence to deny it's existence? The evidence of spirit, our souls, is in the art itself, in love between humans, in our pain, in the miraculous ways we heal and rebuild our lives and broken communities. "

I think so.  But they are different.<br/>How or why does one become interested in something, become motivated enough to study the new area of knowledge, and keep going?<br/>Does the kick from proving a mathematical theorem for a math class or new research do the same thing in the brain as viewing great or not so great art?"
1682,Science,"Real pleasure is about connection. The pleasure I get from eating an ice cream sundae is nothing like the pleasure I get from reading a good book or viewing a work of art because the sundae is not part of a larger conversation, a larger narrative about life and beauty and human history and connection. When I read a book or view a work of art I feel part of something bigger than myself. If I share that ice cream sundae with someone I love, well, that becomes a different story. "
1683,Science,"Put me in the team 3, subcategory ""who cares?"". The addiction to food, sex or art obviously evolved because they endowed some advantage in  survival and proliferation. It takes humans to assign non-existing values to each, categorize as different and then call it high or low. And it's precisely that kind of value judgement that makes people pretend that they enjoy particular wine or art when they actually don't have a clue.<br/><br/>That said, I'd agree that calories or sex, unhealthy ones in particular, leave you mostly empty afterward where as an art may open up a whole new world of looking at things. And it's also uniquely human to be able to rationally choose one addiction over the other for a purpose."
1684,Science,"You're so right.  That sleazy Leonardo is not a proper illustration for the beauty of art.  I could make suggestions, but of course everyone has a different aesthetic ideal, jut as they might for a variety of heirloom tomato."
1685,Science,"And yet, there is great joy in creating art that no one will see and climbing mountains that no one will know about.  Yea, we are apes, but we can also transcend our animal nature into something greater."
1686,Science,"Jimi Hendrix died of a drug overdose. Kieth Richards is still going strong at 75.<br/><br/>Care to revise your theory?<br/><br/>Oh, and I admire Jack LaLane to a degree, but what am I to think of someone who says ""If it tastes good, spit it out.""? That doesn't demonstrate a real understanding of evolution or of pleasure. "
1687,Washington,"Didn't the President promise a response to Syria by Wednesday?  That should free up his calendar for the weekend, correct?<br/>Oh, right - the President just realized that the Summit of Americas will conflict with his golf game at Mar-A-Lago"
1688,Climate,"Are those who expect politicians and bureaucrats to solve perceived problems ""denialists"" of the lessons of economic science, particularly with regard to the school of public choice economics? <br/><br/>If anthropogenic global warming exists and is a threat, the solution is freedom, which fosters resilience and the advance of technology."
1689,Climate,"Drastic action to reverse the negative effects of human caused climate change will not occur until serious, visible, changes begin to affect everyday people. Say for example. The Atlantic Ocean rises 5 feet in one year, or the summer temperature in Phoniex Az is 130 every day, or the entire population of polar bears all die off in a 2 year span. Then people might stop denying the scientist's evidence."
1690,Climate,I can't wait for the day that the climate deniers are in the same category as the Flat Earth Society. 
1691,Climate,"I don't understand the focus on polar bears.  If they are gone one day, so what?  Another species gone ... this happens all the time.  Maybe a new species of something else will arise in the newly warm Arctic.  This is typical:  cuddly polar bears (not really cuddly if you touch them, but superficially cuddly) get all the publicity, but any of the several hundred thousand species of beetles - not a peep.  Those species are dying too - and others are being born.<br/><br/>The blame that ""we caused this"" is bogus.  So what if we did?  Don't lions eat antelopes, and do they worry about the antelopes' potential extinction?  No.  They keep eating them.<br/><br/>So, are we not animals that have bent nature to their desires (just like lions)?  We've done that by learning how to burn fossil fuels, and if lions were smarter they might become more efficient at killing antelopes and storing the meat, until there would be no more antelopes. Lions might disappear.  Why is that an issue (except to lions)?<br/><br/>We call the burning fossil fuels pollution, but the CO2 doesn't care.  It's just a molecule.  Plants like it.<br/><br/>To all the global warmists here, evolution produced humans and humans do as they will, and thatâs part of evolution too, even if they do âstupidâ things.  <br/><br/>Who says that things have to look a certain way (circa 1750)?  Why are polar bears more valuable than beetles?"
1692,Climate,"In other words, the same scientific inquiry responsible for achievements in medicine and technology doesn't know what it's talking about where changes to the climate are concerned.  Climate change is all just one big pink plot designed to take over the world!  Mwhahahaha..! (with interlaced fingers from a dark mansion atop a high cliff on a craggly mountaintop surrounded by bolt after bolt of lightning). <br/><br/>Uh - no.  So why do we still treat deniers' irrational logic as though it were sound by writing about them?<br/><br/>Enough with the articles about deniers and their self-styled boredom masked as legitimate doubt.  We need more articles that describe empirical reality, the solutions to which it points us, and the predictive models that show what will happen if we continue to waste valuable time and energy on those who can't be bothered to do anything other than rabble rouse no matter the topic, but especially when it's climate change.<br/><br/>Good grief."
1693,Climate,"A Nat Geo photographer has posted a number of his photographs of polar bears in their condition on instagram. His photographs show healthy bears, struggling bears, and bears that can no longer walk. The condition of a starving polar bear cannot be denied when you see the photographs taken by this photographer. "
1694,Climate,"Climate change is an undeniable fact.  Insolation of earth depends on the variability of earth's  eccentricity, axial tilt and precession.  These are beyond our control.  What we can control is amount of CO2 we release at present.  However, what I don't understand the point of off-shoring all jobs to developing countries and subject developed countries to strict environmental rules.  That's like losing your keys somewhere and searching for them under the street lamp because it's well lit.  That said, we the people (especially upper middle class in developed countries) can help by (1) substituting veggies for meat (2) traveling/globe trotting less (3)buying less consumer products.  "
1695,Climate,"Unrelated to human activities? What in the ecosystem isn't related to human activities? If climate deniers are scientists, they fail to follow where the scientific observations and evidence leads. What is their agenda? To claim the climate isn't warming is to deny fact. To claim that there's no need for reasonable actions to mitigate it leads only to catastrophic consequences around the world. Climate deniers need to be specific about how to address that. What's their solution? An incomplete data set, more study and no action isn't an acceptable answer. The clock is ticking."

1697,Climate,"It's refreshing to see oil companies make noise about moving from oil, but there are also studies of how to power the whole nation with renewables.  Hydrogen isn't bad - as long as it is produced using renewable energy processes.  But ""massive nuclear"" is massively unpopular, as well as expensive. The new modular nukes might eventually be built, but at the same time they need to grow, the costs for solar, wind and storage - AND for efficiency technologies - continue to drop.<br/><br/>Texas gets over 10% of their electricity from wind now, and they use an awful lot of electricity.

1698,Climate,The skeptics elected another skeptic.<br/><br/>The people didn't like the Obama policy of increasing electricity costs for flyover country to match those of California.  They didn't like Obama's first Secretary of Energy's plan to increase gasoline prices to $10/gallon.  They didn't like the fact that NYC is dumping millions of gallons of raw sewage into the navigable waters of America while the EPA is fining a western rancher for building a watering hole on his private property after obtaining state permits to do so.

1701,Well,"This really is no different for girls. All children are feeling these stresses, though they may manifest differently, but the causes and treatments are the same."
1702,Well,A young friend of mine who has a boy with too much energy and nowhere to put it has installed a trampoline in her living room.  And he loves it and uses it regularly. Great article.
1703,Well,"The insensitivity and lack of common sense exhibited by many parents is so often shocking! For example: I have witnessed on too many occasions kids being taken into candy stores or toy stores and told not to touch or eat anything! Children learn about the world by touching and putting things in their mouths, so to follow this "" order"" goes against every instinct they have and amounts to a form of torture. Tantrums usually erupt and self- involved, harried parents seem genuinely surprised, have to put their cell phones down and actually attend to their kids. What a bother! I often ask myself why they had an offspring to begin with."
1704,Well,Wonderful article. Thank you so much. 
1705,Well,"I taught two years of all-boys classes in a Title I school in FL...we applied for a grant to assist us in setting up single-gender friendly environments, and to train us in single-gender methods of teaching and communicating. Parents were informed of this ""experiment"", and given an option to place their child in a traditional coed classroom. The results were fascinating:<br/><br/>1. The boys did indeed love their one-upmanship ""conversations"" (""yeah, but did YOU know that sharks can ALSO...""), so one of our goals was training the boys to have real conversations that respond to what the other person was saying - not to eliminate their enthusiasm, but to help them code switch when necessary. (Many of my students were minorities.)<br/><br/>2. I needed to give them more breaks than usual - the woman who gives her grandsons breaks above is really helping those boys...we went on timed 10 minute outdoor breaks 3x a day instead of a longer recess, and would often have a 5-10 min ""dance party"" when they were restless or off-task. Trying to control them with nagging or punitive consequences never ""helped"".<br/><br/>3. Finally, the boys did indeed open up tremendously away from girls their age. They discussed their feelings, wrote and illustrated delicate essays, and felt freer to share their fears of the world...but I got through by asking what they thought of a challenging emotional situation rather than how they felt.<br/><br/>TL;DR: This essay is spot on...give boys the time and tools to be happy to be themselves."
1706,Well,"Wow. If boys are so differently wired, such high-maintenance tightly wound bundles of frustration and Jurassic trivia, fighting off tears in math class, having meltdowns at the prospect of homework, and needing to carry soft objects to remain focused and calm, why do they grow up into men who get to run everything? But seriously -- as other commenters have noted, kids male, female, or in between all need a balance of work and play, to commune with the natural world and with peers, and to be heard. We make it so complicated."
1707,Well,"Or as a former teacher of mine said when I asked him why the kids at private schools do so much better than the kids at public schools despite the fact that the latter do better on these tests, it's because the private schools teach the kids to think.<br/><br/>It's sad that only the one percent can give their kids a decent college preparatory education these days."
1708,Well,"No, it's because private school kids have more options."
1709,Culture,"It's postmodern political reality. We love comedy, and the message gets out.  Ideal for the busy viewer, tuning into late night or clicking on you-tube. Most peoples' parents watched nightly comedians. And local channels tend to run the shows. <br/><br/>Researchers found exposure to political satire *encourages* political participation. Satirical comedy supports or calls into doubt oneâs political views. Most of our comedians are progressive, convincing--- and brilliant.<br/>Colbert is especially savvy. <br/><br/>Mr. Trump's been preposterous with lack of transparency, secret finances, emoluments, flying off to Florida, ""storms"" from his past, a white house in chaos, his lawyer acting like Tony Soprano's, inept press staffers who come + go---and a press secretary reminding us of the nun who whacked us with a ruler in class whenever she felt like it. <br/><br/>Biting satire on late night TV? Inevitable. He just isn't presidential.<br/>And isn't funny, or fun. But Obama was a *great* comedian.

1717,Magazine,"As a young guy who both supports the idea of Rhodesia and has friends with similar views, I see a lot of flaws here. I have no doubt that your publication would be first to say that ânot all muslimsâ are Islamist terrorists, so why are you so quick to paint Rhodesia supporters as racists based on the acts of a lone terrorist, who we all agree is insane and wrong? Similarly, how on earth can the Southern Poverty Law Center determine that we are a âhate groupâ because we support the existence of a country? The Turks massacred Armenians, so is everyone that supports the existence of Turkey also a member of a hate group? Are Israel supporters automatically racist hateful colonial islamophobes? <br/><br/>Why, you may ask, would young men support Rhodesia today? Here is a fact: no political force in the history of man has caused more death and suffering than Communism, and the warped dictators who claimed to follow its ideals. This socialist philosophy is alive and well today, particularly in academia. Rhodesia is an example of a democratic, liberty-loving people fighting against socialists sponsored by the USSR, despite having been abandoned by the west. Heroic Rhodesian blacks also fought the communists. <br/><br/>Post-Rhodesia Zimbabwe is a nightmare. We see the same socialist threat, with similar goals, in contemporary South Africa. Yes, there was racism in Rhodesia in the 60-70âs, just like the USA. But we Rhodie supporters could care less about black skin - because the real threat is Red. "
1718,Magazine,"Yes the Cambridge Analytica scandal is truly sinister. But perhaps a moment should be spared to say a greater disgrace is how Facebook has allowed hate movements in Burma to continue for years, basically becoming a tool for genocide. It took 4 and a half years for them to take down the facebook page of U Wirathu, the nationalist monk who compares himself to Hitler and who drives a large degree to the hatred against the Rohingya minority. So many hate sites still proliferate.<br/><br/>I would say our shared collective disgrace is this: severe addiction to online technology is plain in our social lives-- it is not healthy for individuals, families or a sense of community.<br/><br/>But yes, google and the makers of all apps are vacuuming up our data, essentially giving consumers no choice when they download the apps.

1730,Travel,"Two words: Botero Museum. It is not to be missed. We spent a week in Colombia visiting Cartagena, Medellin, Bogota and the Amazon and while the Amazon was certainly the highlight, Botero Museum came in second. My nephew, a sophisticated 20-something, says it's his favorite museum in 'the world!' Did I miss her mention of it in the story? Don't see how you visit this city and not that place. As she says, Museum of Gold is a bore... The other thing that ought to be on anybody's itin for Bogota is the National Police Museum for this reason: You get a free tour with an English-speaking young Colombian doing their year of national service. To spend 45 minutes with a millennial in another country is truly a gift -- to hear not just the substance of the tour, which largely tells the story of the country's triumphant war against Escobar and the druglords, but to be able to ask questions: What are your hopes and dreams? What's it like for young people in Colombia today? If you go to Bogota, fellow readers, these 2 places - Botero Museum and this tour in the police museum - should be at the top of your list imho. "
1731,Travel,"The author's experience largely aligned with ours -- which was lovely.   The warnings about phone use and safety seem a bit overzealous based on our experience, but your experience may vary, I suppose.  For safe transportation, we used the TAPPSI app, which is sort of an Uber for taxis, and gave us an extra degree of certainty as compared with flagging down any passing cab.  "
1732,Travel,"We loved Bogota!  The hot chocolate, the limonada de coco, the brick architectural modernism, the people (formal and sensual at the same time), the food.  I told my friends to grasp Bogota is to imagine that the US had been from the start a gold rush, and early settlers therefore had headed straight to Denver, making it the capital.  "
1733,Travel,"Unless things have changed a lot since I lived in Bogota in the 60s, I'd say the dancers were doing the cumbia, the  Colombian folk dance, rather than the rumba. "
1734,Travel,"Been there many times on business. Not nice at all. First of all I get reprimanded if I leave the airport lobby with no company escort. Same person every time and always hints that he knows where to get the best prostitutes. For a small fee Iâm sure. Then the hotel, an American brand, has a metal detector and bomb sniffing dog that you must get by to enter the lobby. If I were younger I may venture out but Iâm 50 and a target of corruption. I have grey hair and am over six feet tall. That is a bullseye in South America. The beggars and thiefâs donât even call me senor. Itâs Mister. American yes?  <br/><br/>I will never visit on my own expense. Danger keep out. "
1735,Travel,"I visited Bogota twice in my life, one in 1969 and the other in 2008. The city has changed from the military rule to the modern city like somewhere in Europe. Things do not change. People! They are warm and courteous. Their breads are delicious and rare fruits are abundant. I like the museum of Botero, full of his arts and also his collection of arts."

1737,Travel,"My wife and I went to Colombia for a month two years ago. We spent 10 days each in Bogota, Medellin, and Cartagena. Many of our friends and family questioned our sanity, due to safety concerns, but we found, with the usual care taken when navigating large cities, were felt very safe (most of the time). Uber was our transportation of choice for security and convenience, with most fares $3-5.<br/><br/>The thing we liked most about journey was the Colombian people. Despite their violent and complicated history, they remain some of the happiest, most optimistic and proud people we've experienced in all our travels. <br/><br/>Medellin was our favorite because of the mild weather, abundance of flowering trees, and top quality restaurants. Cartagena was a bit too touristy and hot for our tastes, but a charming colonial city worth a short visit.<br/><br/>No trip to Colombia would be complete without going to Bogota. It is steeped in political history and drama and like many big cities, has a wide variety of interesting neighborhoods to explore. We did the same bike tour the author took, which brought us to places we would not have found, or would not have felt safe doing on our own. We also did a graffiti arts walking tour and another tour dedicated to history/ architecture. <br/><br/>The dollar goes a long way in Colombia and it is an easy flight from many U.S. cities. Several of our friends and family have visited Colombia since we came back and told of our very positive experiences. Worthy of consideration. "

Today, in spite of all remaining challenges in many areas, it is unthinkable for any armed group to challenge our country`s stability in such a way. His story also shows another side, that of the courageous  politicians, judges, journalists, soldiers, policemen  and citizens who stood up to him, lost their lives and finally brought him down. In Berlin, for example, there are many reminders of the Holocaust so history is not forgotten or repeated. "
1742,Sports,"Why do any of these girls want this minimum wage quasi prostitution job is what I wonder?  I'm not blaming the women, but why ever would someone want a job with such low pay, insulting and demeaning requirements and having the company who hired you put it in the handbook - in writing: complain once, you're out.  CVS and Target workers are treated better, paid the same and have more humane working conditions.  I just don't know why anyone would want to be a cheerleader if this is what it's about.  Even strippers make way more money and there is full security if anybody gets out of line. "
1743,Sports,Be nice to a groper? Really? What century are they living through - this one or the middle of the last one? <br/><br/>Teachers got fed up and walked out; maybe it's time for some cheerleaders to boycott.
1744,Sports,"Pretty sad how many men blame the cheerleaders, rather than the men who sexually harass them. Why are you justifying the Neanderthal behavior of stupid, drunken football fans? They do not have a God-given right to grope and demean women no matter what they're doing or how they're dressed.<br/><br/>Comparing cheerleaders to someone who flaunts jewelry walking through a bad part of town is ridiculous. Cheerleaders are hired by professional football teams. They have a responsibility to treat and pay the women decently. That they don't says a lot about how rich men think about pretty young women. <br/><br/>No wonder most football team owners are old rich white men. And of course Republicans."
1745,Sports,"They signed up for it, what did they expect?"
1746,Sports,I am shocked! Shocked! to learn that cheerleaders are thought of as sex objects.
1747,Sports,"Its hard to fathom that this has been tolerated for so long.  Can you imagine if fans were going up to the players and grabbing and kissing them?  Would a megastar like Shaq or A-Rod ever put up with that kind of thing?  How about cheerleaders get the same deference and privacy as the players, you can look, you can shout things, but you cant touch or youre getting arrested."
1748,Sports,"I appreciate that these women are all athletic and/or dancers.  I don't care that they are performing on the football field in scanty outfits and pom poms.  It's a performance.  What bothers me is that in their 'off the field' work they get $100 out of the $1200 their employers are paid, and that their employers are, basically, pimping them out.<br/><br/>Yes, pimping them out.  There's no reason why these women can't do their routines on the field and then disappear from view.  That would make them special, more like ballerinas.  Do we ever hear about dance companies sending ballerinas in their tutus into fans' homes for a quiet evening of listening to classical music and sipping champagne while being groped? <br/><br/>If these teams truly wanted these women ""celebrities"" to be ambassadors for their sport, they'd require them to change into proper business attire before mingling.  But, no, they send them wherever with pom poms and bare waists.  We all know why, so let's not be stupid about it or blame the women.<br/><br/>And, please, don't let me next read about ballerinas being pimped out."
1749,Sports,"These women may indeed be talented dancers with years of professional training, but NFL fans are not going to games to appreciate the cheerleaders' dancing ability.  I can imagine only too well the sexual innuendo and come ons these women experience.<br/><br/>The NFL could phase these squads out, or rethink them to be cheer squads that really do athletic cheers.  "
1750,Sports,"Of course everyone, including cheerleaders, has a right to be free of sexual harassment.  But that's not the point.   Let's look at an analagous situation.  Say, a woman (or a man) likes to wear flashy jewelry.  The woman is told that it is dangerous for her to walk around a certain neighborhood wearing her flashy jewelry. The woman takes the position that she has the right to walk anywhere she wants wearing any flashy jewelry she wants, proceeds to walk through the bad neighborhood wearing her flashy jewelry and is promptly mugged and robbed.  In that situation, no would claim that the person robbing her was justified in doing so.  But there would be litle if any sympathy for the woman for having been foolish enough to wear her flashy jewelry in a bad neighborhood.  It's the same thing here.  Of course, cheerleaders have the right to wear skimpy, suggestive outfits, mingle with fans and not be groped or sexually harassed.  But those women who choose to engage in such activity deserve little, if any, sympathy if as a result they are subjected to unwanted harassment."
1751,Sports,"It's so wrong for teams to send the cheerleaders out to private homes.  Think of the setting: the homeowners feel entitled, inhibitions are lowered by alcohol, the cheerleaders are dressed in a provocative costume, and everybody is out of sight of security officials.  That's a scene that invites violation of norms.<br/><br/>It's not quite as wrong to send them into luxury boxes-- at least the setting is in the stadium.  On the other hand, the setting is sequestered, there's alcohol and people are in a mood to let loose.  Also, the patrons might think the cheerleaders are here to entertain me and well what's the harm of me putting my arm around one.  After all, why are the cheerleaders there if not to charm high-rollers with their looks? I'm not saying that makes it okay for high-rollers to put their hands all over the cheerleaders, but be realistic...<br/><br/>Maybe the answer is to only use the cheerleaders on the playing field.<br/><br/>Now, as far as the women who choose to cheer, I am not blaming the victim, but I have to say that the women should see that they are putting themselves in a very vulnerable position by consigning themselves to jobs with low pay and zero job security, jobs that value them as pretty objects in flirty costumes, jobs that take away their power of complaint.<br/><br/>Again, that they choose to put themselves in vulnerable position doesn't justify rude fan behavior. "
1752,Sports,"If the women are not well compensated, face demeaning work conditions, and lack any path to a better position, why do this work?"
1753,Sports,"What am I missing here? If you don't want sexist, draconian rules, less-than-minimum-wage compensation, demeaning treatment and fans who harass you in 'push-up bras and fringed skirts' -- then stop doing this! The NFL is losing its audience and will do anything to attempt to keep it, including providing its version of 'The Man Show.'  And they'll keep doling out this kind of treatment as long as there are women willing to accept it. Don't let them!"
1754,Sports,Considering the compensation the women receive how do they live? Why do they want to be cheerleaders?
1755,Sports,"When you only have scantily clad female cheerleaders working in a hyper-macho sport that feeds on physical violence, this is the end result for these women.  It's the worst example of sexploitation as well as the very health and well-being of the male behemoths battering each other brains into concussions and later CTE.  It's what you would expect in ancient Rome not 21st century America.  But then again, we elected just such a man as president who treats women as sexual objects and condones physical violence against others. "
1756,Sports,"I don't walk through a park at midnight, wearing expensive jewelry.  If I did and were robbed, people would understandably question why I would put myself in that situation.  Yes, the thief is responsible for his actions but if I behave in ways that attract thieves, I am an idiot.  If you don't want to be salivated over by drunken men, find a different profession."
1757,Sports,"Not trying to be offensive, but itâs an idiotic job. So be prepared to be treated accordingly."
1758,Sports,"I'm embarrassed when cheerleaders are performing when I'm at any sporting match. It makes me feel uncomfortable, especially if I'm with female friends. <br/><br/>And the older I get,  the more seeing them makes me feel like I'm a dirty old man just to look their way. I'd just rather cheerleaders weren't there."
1759,Sports,"Once you examine the role football plays in American culture, you realize it's not about the game. Fans expect football to reinforce their prejudices, and to keep black men and all women in their place. When black players protested racism, white fans were outraged. How dared those uppity black men step out of their proper roles to fulfill white men's macho fantasies? Football treats women the same way: as bodies who exist to entertain men and to fulfill their fantasies."
1760,Sports,"One of the many things to admire about The New York Giants organization! They've never had cheerleaders! It's all about the game, as it should be! None of this nonesense where females are essentially being exploited as a sideshow, having nothing to do with the nuances of the great game! Bravo to the present and historical Mara-Tisch ownership!!!"
1761,Sports,"It is not pleasant to see people, yet again, coming up with excuse after excuse and alibi after alibi for drunken, dimwit behavior from a pack of yahoos who think they're entitled to do as they please with real live women. "
1762,Sports,"To all the readers asking why women would audition and fight to become a cheerleader:  cultural values and opportunities.  Our culture values football just as much as it values patriotism and supporting the troops.  Women can only participate in the sport by being cheerleaders.  Our culture also values womenâs looks.  Young women understand this.  Their opportunity to be a part of Americaâs cultural values starts at a very young age.  Cheerleading is one of a handful of sports that is offered in every high school for girls.   With Title 9, women have finally been allowed to participate in more sports.  Soccer, wrestling, pole vaulting, basketball.  These were male sports twenty years ago.  For soccer and basketball there are professional womenâs teams, but for the others...no.  And even if professional, the women who play will not make the same amount of money as professional male counterparts.  Institutional sexism is alive and well.  Girls learn young that they are valued for their beauty more than their brains or their athleticism. We need to change this.  I see a change coming with the likes of some of our greatest athletes Serena Williams and Chloe Kim.  Letâs support sports where women are treated respectfully and provide more opportunities for young women to get into these types of sports.  "
1763,Sports,"The concept at law is ""assumption of the risk,"" similar to the foul ball risk that a baseball fan takes when sitting just above the dugout.  No woman tries out for a NFL cheerleader job who does not acknowledge that she is selling her peace of mind.  The very notion that cheerleaders have a right to be outraged by the very exigencies that they knew in advance is chilling.  Does a high steelworker know he takes a risk?  Does a soldier know he/she might be killed?  Does a jockey know he could be thrown and trampled?  The notion that Americans should be protected from the risks they assume for economic gain is foreign to the law and contrary to our social norms.  Our law allows people to knowingly take risks and deal with the consequences.  "
1764,Sports,Cheerleaders are amazing athletics. Let's keep them and respect them!
1765,Sports,"Yes, very well put, majordomo!!! "
1766,Sports,So why do they do it? Iâm sure they can find better jobs.
1767,Sports,"So Larry, people's jobs should disappear just because social justice warriors object to them. That's opening a pretty nasty can of worms, I think. How about vegans getting the beef industry shut down? Muslims getting all the breweries, distilleries and wineries shut down. Or the Amish campaigning to get what's left of the auto industry closed.<br/><br/>As an outsider, I am saddened to see the USA, once the beacon of liberty slide into some form of theocracy where the feminist ""Ayatollahs"" can get anyone's job proscribed.<br/><br/>Oh, and I think you'll find the employers will act pretty decisively to stamp out harassment once the litigation starts!"
1768,Sports,"The issue is more complex than that. Perhaps there should be laws against sending these girls into dangerous situations as described. Then it wouldn't be part of the job - problem fixed. <br/><br/>Another issue is whether harassing behaviour, as documented here, is something we can improve on as a society. If it is something we can improve on, then it is worth while these girls complaining to further push better education of boys and adolescents in terms of respect and interaction with females.<br/><br/>On the other hand if you believe there will always be some male personality types that will harass and this can't be changed, then the first option of outlawing the more risky parts of the job description may be more worthwhile."
1769,Sports,"Dear Meg,<br/>I agree, but as with women who want to be strippers, these women should understand the downside of their work environment.  Like men who want to be sanitation workers because it's a vital necessity should know that lots of bad smells will assault them.  If women work at a job that entails dancing around in an approximation of a bikini in front of drunken, low-class men, then they are going to get catcalls.  If they get within reach they'll get groped.  It's unfortunate but that's how society is right now."
1770,Sports,"Dan, that is the same weak excuse/threat hurled at women back in the 19th century when they first got out into the work force and did ""respectable"" jobs like secretary or clerk. The argument then is that ""good"" women stayed at home and were wives/mothers only; only ""bad"" women were ""out in the streets"" working and deserved whatever happened to them because they were out in a ""man's world"". And it's still used to shame women who are just trying to work/earn money to live. "
1771,Sports,Who said anything about ignoring the constitution? If everyone stopped going - it would stop being a sport anyone cared about. Let the stadiums rust...
1772,Sports,"To be fair, if anyone wants to see strippers dance, they should go to strip clubs, and pay accordingly. When they come to a game, they expect a game. Sure, there'll always be a portion of those fans, mostly inebriated men, looking for something else. NFL should not have encouraged such bad behavior.<br/><br/>That said, no one wants to admit as much, but everyone watching these cheerleaders in skimpy costumes is not expecting anything otherwise than sex appeal. For the cheerleaders to deny that fact, is just whitewash. <br/><br/>And no, no one - not men nor women - should he groped or harassed, even if they are strippers or prostitutes. If these women have the self-respect, they should walk, rather than whinge about it. If the teams need you, they would at least start paying you living wage. If they don't, well it's never meant to be."
1773,Sports,"...sending them out, outside of the game environment, makes sex objects out of them?  And what to say of perky, attractive, half-dressed women jumping up and down with pompoms??  If that ain't 'sex object', I don't know what is."
1774,Sports,"Whether or not they could 'snag' a wealthy patron or player, their being a pro-sports cheerleader simply increases their status and desirability in the general populace dating pool.  I'm sure that's why some also do it.  And because they simply want that kind of attention...it boosts their own self-image."
1775,Sports,agree! not least because there is no line beyond which women can be said to be Â´sexualising themselvesÂ´inappropriately. 
1776,Sports,"The minute a class action suit, probably not legally appropriate here,  is filed, the ""Cheerleaders"" will go the way of the ""Single Wing"" and the leather helmet.  If the purpose of this piece is to protect them, it's misplaced.  If the purpose of this piece is about better compensation, as is possible, it may be effective.  Abuse me and objectify me, but pay me more. <br/><br/>Why not solve the problem and cease employing ""Cheerleaders"" altogether?  It's not like they add anything to the mix."
1777,Sports,Getting distracted by the pictures accompanying this very disturbing article (before addressing what it actually says) cuts right to the heart of the issue. Itâs time to listen to women and do something about the predominant male-gaze<br/>-focused culture that encourages the practice of treating women like disposable sex toys and not human beings. 
1778,Sports,Have you ever tended bar in a gay bar?  I have and its not just women that get groped on the job:)  I quit the last job over this very issue.  
1779,Sports,"I remember when I was little, Princeton had male cheer-leaders. If they need to be led in cheering, they can hire men. Itâs true there are other venues more suitable for near naked women. "
1780,Sports,"To be an NFL cheerleader in the first place is absurd. They know going in that they're not going to get paid squat and that they are subject to any number of ridiculous rules about weight and fraternization and the like. They did it anyway. As for being sent to private residences, no one put guns to their heads.<br/><br/>The government can't solve all of our problems, and in this case, I don't see any problem that can't be solved by folks who don't choose to participate not participating. We live in a sexist nation and a sexist world. If you're a cheerleader, you are aiding and abetting sexist practices that could not exist absent your willing and voluntary participation. Quit whining about it and just quit."
1781,Sports,"Because itâs not about the money. They love what they do: dancing, choreography, movement. It's an art form. The system realizes that and takes advantage of this situation. It's funny that not even one single NFL team owner has a different view on payment with this issue. They all fall in line with the minimum wage principle without exception. That's why I like college football more. The schools make the big money but at least the players and the cheerleaders are on equal footing."
1782,Sports,"Sharon â if the women feel they are being wrongfully pimped out, they are free to quit.   The idea that someone other than the cheerleaders themselves would know what's better for them is ludicrous.  In a free market system, these women are free to throw in their poms and quit at any time, for any reason.   "
1783,Metro,"A basic problem is choosing NYCEDC to develop this project, which is not a transit agency.  The whole idea was to screw the MTA and the governor by having it built outside of their jurisdiction.  The MTA's predecessor public an private companies all ran streetcars, so to have EDC (not even NYCDOT) run this thing was just plain...dumb. "
1784,Metro,Has there ever been a movement to divorce the MTA from the New York Governor's purview in terms of how the Governor can currently  nominate governance members? Would it be better if nominations for governance were restricted to NYC and other counties in which the MTA operates?
1785,Metro,"A streetcar is way too expensive for something so unnecessary. A select bus with a dedicated, enforced bus only lane would accomplish the same thing and be much cheaper and easier to adapt if needed. A streetcar would need a lane of traffic so why not make it a bus lane? Of course, this would not be glamorous or hip. "
1786,Metro,of course not.  because it would be laughed at by ny residents who have no use whatsoever for this project.
1787,Styles,"If you were having a bad work day, or fighting with your boyfriend, or maybe felt like your dim apartment really needed something, a trip to Moss was just the thing.

1790,Magazine,"I started reading this profile while allegedly ""working"", having every intention of skimming and then coming back to it later. But I didn't do that. Two paragraphs in, I went to the website for the Portland Public Library and put every title by Tracy K. Smith on hold. This is a beautiful piece -- the journalism as lovely and as touching as the subject itself -- and it is incredibly exciting and rewarding to see the NYT giving this kind of time and depth to a remarkable poet. Really, nothing more to say, except that my day has been made by this love letter to language, memory and the power of an honest and rich voice. "
1791,Learning,"This picture or image is depicting a few things in my opinion. On the one side of the graduation cap, there are stairs after a leading red carpet. This shows me that the people have an easy time just walking up to graduation using the stairs. On the other side of the cap is the tassel that looks like a rope that one person is trying to climb in a way. This shows that other people have to put in an exceeding amount of effort in order to get to the place that they want to be; graduation. Either way, people have to do something, easy or hard, that helps them get to the point of graduating high school or college. Once they get to the top of the cap, which would seem like college or everyday life, it shows the people conversing and sitting down and just relaxing on top of the cap. This feels like the image is saying that once you graduate from wherever you are, it is all nice, and fun and games. Once you go through the hard work or the easy breeze through of high school or college, everything else seems to just slow down and relax after the stressful time of school. I personally doubt that it is actually like that in everyday life and I am not sure if my depiction is ""right,"" but I have a feeling that in real life, it does not seem as relaxed and easy as this picture may portray that. "
1792,Learning,If I was to  be in a Pop-Up class I would love to have a class that talks about a healthy living style. I have always struggled being able to maintain a good diet as well as a good work out. Being able to have a class that could guide me in the right direction as well as give me tips on good ways to maintain a diet would be very beneficial to me. I would go to a class like that and many others struggle with the the thing so I think many people would attend a class like that as well to better improve themselves. It would be interesting for a lot of people so I feel that this would be a good and effective class to have.
1793,Learning,"I think that pop-up classes are a really good idea. It gives students an opportunity to try classes that they would want to try but not do for the whole year. I would choose to attend these classes in my free time because they could be fun and interesting. I might want to try something like the ""Am I Charlie"" class relating to current events. I would want to take a pop up class about ancient art, maybe where we look at ancient art and cooking and try to make some of our own."
1794,Learning,"Pop-up classes are a fun way to connect with others and learn about topics that arenât always discussed in school. When I first saw this topic I thought to myself, âWhy would anyone want to give up their Friday night for more classes are optional?â To my surprise as I read the article, I actually became interested in these short-term classes.<br/>Pop-up classes are a great way to experience classes you would never actually get to take in school at a low risk. These classes are completely optional and donât cost any money. Since these classes donât count towards your grade, you wonât experience the normal stress of a class. I found it interesting that if a Pop-up class gets big enough, it can actually count towards the credits you need. One class the article talked about that I found interesting was the Self-Determination class.<br/>I would definitely try out a Pop-up class if they were offered at my school! It would be a great mental break for me to escape from the stress of my other classes and focus on something I enjoy. "

1802,Business,"Because, in this democracy, people should let their betters decide what they do?"
1803,OpEd,"So 40% of Americans love loud mouthed over-confident leaders, big talking showmen, who are short on facts and long on promises.  The only thing that's surprising is that it's ONLY 40%.  If anything you do ensures that it stays at 40% then you're doing very well, as the natural tendency is for this kind of support to feed on itself and grow - so you're running to stand still, which is pretty good given what you're up against.<br/><br/>One thing Americans will not tolerate is leaders who lie and break the law.  Opposition should focus on just 1 or 2 cases of this and blow them up out of proportion and ignore everything else that he does that is reprehensible.  Don't get distracted with every new tweet, doing that you're just like a dog chasing after every rabbit that pops its head out of its hole: you'll never catch your prey."
1804,OpEd,"A beautiful &amp; impassioned essay, David, but you make one glaring error, about the main reason Trump took the presidency. Regardless of how many folks felt that their local economies are ""under attack"", there is only one real reason for this presidency: the Electoral College awarded it to him. The people didn't want this. You sound like you need some encouragement. I suggest you read your colleague Michelle Goldberg's article - just across from yours on the opposite-ed page."
1805,OpEd,"Democrats and those opposed to Trump allowed him to use the Media (which acted dishonestly) to frame the narrative.  The only attack on the Media should be a vetting of the truth, starting with FOX faux News.  I have no problem with Fox espousing lies, but I do have a problem with them being allowed to pretend they are a news outlet doing so.  At minimum, this is a violation of truth in advertising!<br/><br/>Fox, of course, as a tabloid is ideally made for a demagogue as they are interested in sensationalism, not facts or the truth.  Democrats and anti-Trump Republicans have to find a way to discredit Fox.  Then they must create their own dialogue.<br/><br/>I would start by stating the obvious:  Trump is lying to you.  Look at what he has done, not at what he says.  Little he has done has improved the lives of the people he promised to support except the religious right.  To them I would point out that their hypocrisy is essentially anti-Christian and their leaders were manipulated.  Is that what you want?  The road to ...<br/><br/>However, if there is no alternative narrative of hope that is stated loudly (instead of assumed like in the Clinton campaign), Trump will continue his dangerous actions until he either tries for a soft coup with support of the Republican sheep in Congress or does something so dangerous everyone decides he needs to be removed.<br/><br/>Time to wake up!"
1806,Metropolitan,"In San Francisco Alex Nieto was shot by the SFPD while eating a burrito in a park on the way to his job because somebody assumed that a Latino in a 49ers jacket must be a gang-banger.

1807,Metropolitan,"So, basically, some people started a spiteful rumor about who made the call, but it turned out that they were wrong.  So you wrote a column that pretends that they were right.  Because...?<br/><br/>Is there a second part to this?"

(I understand that there is some overlap between white and ethnic minority members.)<br/>Economically, is there a difference between a displacement of poorer people by wealthier or more middle income people (such as is occurring in parts of Brooklyn) and the displacement of white middle class and working class people by poorer people that occurred occurred in the middle parts of last century in Brooklyn?  Here, the argument is that poor people have nowhere else to go right now whereas during the displacement (or arguable voluntary migration) of last century the middle class and working class whites had other places to go.  I am not sure that I agree with the argument but I think that it is the best that one can make in opposition to gentrification."

The unwillingness of media to point out that just because someone FEELS that something is true doesn't make it so.  <br/><br/>Who knew that America had so many ""psychics""? There are people around each of us who are constantly telling stories of their own victimization based on looks or expressions on faces, or ""tone"" they don't appreciate. It is amazing how they can TELL exactly what motivates that look or tone. Hint: it's always about them, never about something else.  You can call it narcissism or stereotyping.  Whatever.  On occasion they're probably right, but it's trouble waiting to happen to just automatically assume that every claim based on ""I could just tell"" is correct. ""Fishing expedition"" indeed."
1814,Metropolitan,"As someone who travels throughout the world in large cities in Asia and Europe, its often obvious that I am an outsider. More than often, i am treated with curious kindness.

1815,Metropolitan,"Yesterday the police came to our Bed-Stuy Building for information on a homicide that occurred right around the corner. The day before, I almost walked into a shooting a few blocks away. Some months earlier, I'd almost entered another shooting if not for divine providence. <br/><br/>My white presence in this neighborhood has nothing to do with the shootings mentioned above. However, exposed to this sort of thing despite my most heartfelt desire that it be a myth, will unfortunately result in calling the cops for erratic behavior. <br/><br/>After all -- in what kind of neighborhood do neighbors SHOOT EACH OTHER?

In my college town a frequent flyer (someone who'd had countless psychiatric 911 calls) received something like 40 bullets for answering the door with his unloaded flair gun.<br/><br/>Part of it is our training of police to protect their lives over those they've sworn to protect at all cost ... and the other part is our complete abandonment of those in need of psychiatric care and the sorry state our entire medical system is in right now.<br/><br/>How about we talk about some real solutions to these social problems ... than blaming individual police officers or family members for the situation we've put them in."

1827,Politics,That's one of the reasons I walked away from teaching.  They spent a fortune on testing and demanded the curriculum conform to their ever changing demands.  The third quarter was always so depressing.  All we did was prep kids for tests.
1828,Washington,"By raiding Michael Cohen's office, the FBI has violated the attorney-client privilege."
1829,Washington,"To say I dislike 45 is a gross understatement but I won't have a party until this is over and dotus and his sycophants get whats coming to them.<br/>Sorry to say that I am losing faith in the so called ""system""."
1830,Washington,Even if you are a Trump hater you have to admit this is a violation of human rights. If Mueller does this and do=es not find what he is looking for he should not only be fired but go to jail. This is such a witch hunt. WOW -W_F
1831,Washington,"I have often read that Michael Cohen says that he would take a bullet for Trump and his family. Now it looks like he has arrived at the test, but the bullet is not a bullet, but rather the endurance required in accepting a long prison term, a sacrifice which may not be sufficient to save this president or his presidency.<br/>If I were a betting man, Iâd bet he will flip and he will testify against Trump."
1832,Washington,"And all the king's horses and all the king's men,<br/>couldn't put Humpty together again"
1833,Washington,"On Nov. 17, 1973, President Richard M. Nixon held a news conference before AP managing editors in Orlando, Fla., in which he defended himself against a number of allegations. <br/><br/>Most of the questions related to the Watergate break-in, which had become even more of a scandal a month earlier with the âSaturday Night Massacre.â <br/><br/>(On Oct. 20, 1973, in the so-called âSaturday Night Massacre,â President Richard M. Nixon abolished the office of special Watergate prosecutor Archibald Cox, and accepted the resignation of Attorney General Elliot L. Richardson and fired Deputy Attorney General William B. Ruckelshaus for their refusal to fire Mr. Cox.)<br/><br/>Other questions focused on reports that he had cheated on his tax returns.<br/><br/>The best-remembered part of the news conference came as the president defended himself against claims that he had illicitly profited from his years in public service. <br/><br/>âI made my mistakes, but in all of my years of public life, I have never profited, never profited from public service â I earned every cent,â he said. âAnd in all of my years of public life, I have never obstructed justice. <br/><br/>And I think, too, that I could say that in my years of public life, that I welcome this kind of examination, because people have got to know whether or not their president is a crook. Well, I am not a crook. I have earned everything I have got.â<br/><br/><a href=""https://learning.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/11/17/nov-17-1973-nixon-declares-i-am-not-a-crook/"" title=""https://learning.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/11/17/nov-17-1973-nixon-declares-i-am-not-a-crook/"" target=""_blank"">https://learning.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/11/17/nov-17-1973-nixon-declares...</a><br/><br/>History is about to repeat itself..."
1834,Washington,"What's not to like? Trump fighting Trump.  Last Friday, Trump dangled Michael to the press regarding hush money payments knowing that Michael would ignore them.  In response, the Deep State Shark aka the Rule of Law snatched Michael and Trump's arm in the process.  <br/><br/>I'm most certain Trump's inane statements were quoted in the search warrant. Clearly, Michael Cohen won't be paying any bar dues in the foreseeable future.  Precisely in such moments, facts are such stubborn, yet lovely things. <br/><br/>Ultimately it is most fitting, to recall Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s powerful words, ""The rough places will be made plain  and the crooked places will be made straight.""   We must always strive to remain a country that is governed by the rule of law and not Trumpism---a reality show of fascism. "
1835,Washington, Anyone who gets involved with donald eventually winds up under the bus. 
1836,Washington," This isn't about Russia but about bank fraud and campaign financing or other related financial type crimes referred to the FBI by Mueller but not part of that investigation per se.  Why wouldn't more than one type of criminal activity occur working for a person who has no problem with right or wrong, truth or lies as long as they are in his favour.   Legal or illegal this is not a concern.  Trump spent his who adult life not caring about such virtues why should anyone even a Trumpster be surprised?  Lets not think anyone painted a target on his back he did that himself by himself and he certainly doesn't know an American Patriot from a Russian one. "
1837,Washington,"DON'T TAKE THE BAIT BY FIRING MUELLER, PRESIDENT TRUMP...the Democrats and FAKE NEWS media are praying that President Trump fires Mueller. They know it would guarantee a Democrat victory and they would never stop writing that they were right that Trump was hiding his Russian collusion with their bogus story. Americans should not pressure President Trump to take the bait.<br/><br/>President Trump has to be patient and wait for the report from Inspector General, Michael Horowitz, combined with the actions prosecutor, U.S. Attorney John Huber, would follow up with. That would be real news that would totally discredit Mueller and his bogus investigation."
1838,Washington,"Itâs not comedic. I stand ready to march if mueller is fired. If mueller needs a data analyst, receptionist or coffee getter, I would indeed work without pay for him."

1841,Washington,The fact that he referred this issue out to the appropriate prosecutors in Manhattan shows that he is doing his job by the book and staying in his lane.
1842,Washington,"If facts are of interest to you, the surveillance was not of the Trump campaign, but of foreign nationals whose calls were being monitored; i.e. Russian operatives.<br/>What was the Trump campaign doing talking to known Russian operatives?<br/>The only sewer is the current White House.<br/>Steam-cleaning won't be good enough."
1843,Washington,"Maybe, just maybe, it's because it isn't Hillary that is crooked.  Have you checked Trump's business history?"
1844,Washington,"And all the plea deals require the crooks to cooperate with ANY investigation Muller indicates, not just Mueller's.  All Failing 45's dirty bois have to spill their guts for state and local trials."
1845,Washington,"Please enumerate what headway Trump has made. Not what he SAYS heâs done or doing, but what he has ACTUALLY accomplished. Thereâs no wall, the tax cut (which was mainly for the rich and corporations was really congressional doing more so than Trump), the travel ban struck down in court, most of Pruittâs environmental roll-backs (the ones he hasnât already backed down on) held up in court...I could go on but Iâll leave it to you to let me know otherwise.<br/><br/>Iâll grant that heâs deported a lot of people, but not the ones he promised to. Instead of âbad hombres,â heâs gone after the low-hanging fruit of hard working families, DACA, and the parents of US citizens. And oh yeah, alienated all of our allies. Some headway.<br/><br/>P.S. Just in case no one has told you: Obama has no authority over the DOJ, the FBI, or the state of New York."
1846,BookReview,"Douthat's attitudes (in his columns, and as reported in this review),  brought to mind this passage from ""Everybody Dies"" by Lawrence Block (1998), and though its subject is fundamentalists, it seems to fit those  religious folks of any faith who insist on the infallability of their beliefs:<br/>""If thereâs one thing the fundamentalists of the world have in common itâs the conviction that Godâs all-powerful, but Heâs screwed unless they help Him out.â "
1847,BookReview,"Superb review except for this cheap shot attibuted to dissenting Catholics: ""By what right do those child-abuse-indulging clerics tell me that my marriage is adulterous?"" Catholics dissent because Church teaching is counter-cultural, insistent on sacrifice and self-control, united to the suffering of Christ on the cross, and Biblical. "
1848,BookReview,Not a day goes by that I don't miss Pope Benedict xi. 
1849,BookReview,"The irony of Douthat's position is that as a layman he is critiquing the clerical caste, i.e., the Pope while simultaneously maintaining that that caste is the source of all wisdom."
1850,BookReview,"Catholicism is not alone in this struggle to ""handle"" culture.  Many other Christian branches are sucked into this current.  Rather than a desire to ""liberalize"" the church, many believers and leaders now recognize that even cultural change can be a critique of an unchanging doctrinal schema.  When that happens, thoughtful leaders and members may find that reexamining the foundations of traditional beliefs slaps their certainty into a new humility that no longer assumes they had it ""right"" the first time.  All doctrine, including Catholic, has evolved and yes, changed, over the centuries.  Not all of it has been helpful or productive when believers look back.  While tradition is very important, it is not so sacrosanct that new insights (dare we say ""truths"") cannot challenge it."
1851,BookReview,I am amused that conservative Catholics believed in the primacy of the Pope and his teachings until a less conservative Pope was elected.  Now they all seem to believe they are more Catholic than the Pope which is an oxymoron for truly devout Catholics.  Either the Pope is chosen by God to guide the faithful when he is elected by the College of Cardinals or the whole thing is a sham used to disguise the rather messy politics inside the Catholic church.  Which is it Mr. Douthat?
1852,BookReview,"The real traditionalist here is Francis, who wants to go back to Jesus' teachings about caring for the poor and suchlike. Douthat, in contrast, wants more the Catholicism of the Middle Ages, when Rome was in charge of sexual practices, interest rates, and a whole bunch of other things that Catholic ""conservatives"" long to regain power over."
1853,BookReview,"This Pope told the Cardinals that they would be sorry they elected him. (It could have been sooner, he was runner-up to Pope Benedict eight years before.) People like Douthat who convert to Catholicism join because they love the strict rules and regulations. Someone is setting them on the ""right"" path.  Pope Benedict definitely enhanced these teachings and engaged in pageantry that hadn't been seen for decades. Any Pope would have been more lenient than Benedict. Pope Francis, always a priest of the people, is a shock to those conservative Catholics who loved being told exactly how to practice the faith. Just as evangelicals have prostituted themselves to follow Trump. so have the Douthat type of Catholic. They are so focused on their one issue, abortion, that yesterday, the Pope stated that caring for the migrant and poor is equally important. What a shock. Life is sacred even if it isn't in the womb! This is not what those who are more Catholic than the Pope want to hear. It totally ruins their agenda. They would rather follow a trice married philanderer, liar, cheat, bully than give up on their rallying cry, life in the womb is sacred, but after that those people can starve to death. We don't care. "
1854,BookReview,"I will not read this book, as I am not Catholic nor am I a real fan of Douthat or his writing or his politics.<br/>But as a student of religion and a staunch liberal (which may be why I'm not Catholic), I find Douthat's conservatism about his Catholicism and his questioning of the Pope somewhat disconcerting.  Not for me - but for him.<br/>My understanding of Catholic teaching is that the Pope is God's representative on Earth.  That his election, however flawed it may seem to our human eyes, is guided by God and thus infallible.  Perhaps times and Catholicism have changed since the days of the High Middle Ages when Popes were, for all intents and purposes, God on Earth, but surely someone so steeped in scripture and Catholic doctrine and love of the Church, as Douthat professes, must fear for his soul by questioning the Pope.<br/>The fact is that the Church (with a big ""C"") has changed mightily over the years.  And in order for it to remain relevant on an international scale it must continue to change.  This may be painful for some Catholics.<br/>To an outsider, and a student of history, Pope Francis seems a breath of fresh air to a church that has been so scandalized as to be almost marginalized by its own believers.  What is wrong with focusing your efforts on helping the poor and downtrodden (often in the guise of the immigrant)?  That seemed to be what Jesus - in whose image the church was created - focused on.  Not who slept with who and questions of marriage.  "
1855,BookReview,"Thank you for this thoughtful review.  While Ross Douthat is, no doubt, highly intelligent, he seems to have little compunction about critiquing a field that he has, to my knowledge, few credentials to critique, other than being a practicing Catholic, which seems to be secondary to being a practicing conservative.  To my knowledge, he is not seminary trained, he has not worked in the church - he is long on opinion and short on wisdom in this regard.  If this were the practice of medicine, we would say he has exceeded his scope of practice.  Were it a bar, we'd say he's a gadfly.  There are better books on the church written by authentic scholars of ecclesiology.  "
1856,BookReview,"Which Catholics believe in the primacy of the Pope's teachings, when he is not speaking ex cathedra?"
1857,Science,"Why is the EU, which sticks its nose into virtually every thing, allow the importation and sale of potentially dangerous and invasive non-native species that can cause immeasurable damage to local environments?  We're apparently not any better.  No one needs a python or anaconda or tiger as a ""pet"".  Smuggling will always go on, but to just allow the wide spread importation, sale and possession of such creatures is insane and dangerous."
1858,Science,"Aside from the obvious disaster that these ""pets"" have caused when they are released/escape into the wild (pythons in Florida, lionfish in the carribean, etc) there are millions of perfectly great companion animals killed every year in this country because they aren't wanted or exotic enough.  Leave the wild animals in the woods and work to preserve their home habitat and get yourself a rescue animal. You, the animal, the environment, wild creatures  and the world will be a better place. If you get your thrills from feeding mice to snakes, maybe get some therapy first. "
1859,Science,How many people have the skill to keep these creatures alive? It can be very demanding. So they end up dead or released with the kind of problems Florida is experiencing. Even here in the U.S. rare snakes are stolen for sale. I had a license to foster one that was injured when the zoo lacked hands and space. It was subsequently stolen from the zoo and found dead in a bag in a car trunk where it was left in the 100 degree heat. Pointless. 
1860,Washington,"...and when China will see US has exceeded his capacity to pay its dept and US economy is going down, Chineses will ask for US treasury bond refund to finish you guys off, put US treasury in bankruptcy. China will become world's leading economy. If I was President Xi, I would fund Trump's campaign HUGELY."
1861,Washington,"Let history not only blame Mr. Trump, but the other two stooges in the room: Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell. As 20 and 30 year old struggle under lowering salaries and staggering debt, only dreaming of home ownership (let alone future savings) let the baby boomers who voted for this administration hang their heads in shame. They destroy this country for a few silver pieces. "
1862,Dining,"Having never knowingly met a vintner I only have textual tastes. They are simply happy farmers. I have met several of them, in other fields. I have worked on a farm. It is not as dull as IBM, but that is just this human problem. Folks want to be believable. What a farce :)"
1863,Dining,Close enough for government work
1864,Weekend,I love this idea.  John Oliver showed that audiences appreciate a deep dive on issues that they may not know much about.  I'm excited to see a full season deep dive on an incredibly relevant issue that people may not have personal experience with but want exposure to new stories to understand what everyone is going through.  Very exciting.
1865,Weekend,"I am constantly hearing about police reform, but nothing about anyone else's need to reform.  Other people, other races do not seem to have such a problem with the police.  Like what if MLK Boul. meant it was the best part of town?  But really, why not some other reforms, if for no other reason than to make it more interesting, perhaps, even funny?"
1866,NewsDesk,"Oy, too cute for comfort..."
1867,NewsDesk,"Girl, get a menstrual cup. Come on now."
1868,NewsDesk,Just loving this series. Thank you for your keen observations and advice!
1869,NewsDesk,"I don't know if this counts as passing as a local, but as another hapa it was in Java that I most often got asked ""Are you Indonesian?"" They didn't expect an American from California."
1870,NewsDesk,"What a crazy, exciting, enlightening (and at times overwhelming) work and life experience Jada!  I applaud the NYT and you for taking on the task, opening the readers' to new places AND being an example to other single people, especially women who might be hesitant to head out to see the world alone.  <br/><br/>As a 64 yr old female travel addict, in my early 20's couldn't wait each week to read the NYT Sunday Travel section, I started traveling, sometimes with a girlfriend. sometimes alone. In my 30's did a 9 month 'round the world trip alone with my baby daughter strapped to my back (budget travel, with backpack and a trusty guide book), which was amazing AND exhausting!.  <br/><br/>Travel is an unforgettable education yielding experiences and memories of lifetime -- no trip is the same, not always easy, but always, always worth it!  "
1871,NewsDesk,"Jada:  what on earth are you doing in Rogue River, OR?  I thought you were in South America!  :)<br/><br/>Jeff in Boise (east of RR, OR)"
1872,NewsDesk,"Last year I went to India for the first time.  Now, when I meet someone who I think might be from India, I ask them if they are. They first react with trepidation to my question, until I tell them that I visited India and loved it. And with that, 2 strangers become friends. For me, travelling has done so much to help me see everyone in the world as just another relative on this journey we call life. I'm so grateful. And so inspired by your column!"
1873,NewsDesk,Am often mistaken for Dutch if in a country with Dutch history (like The Netherlands Antilles for instance).  Makes sense since my heritage is Dutch.  Never happens in the Netherlands though---they can spot my Americanness a mile away!  :)
1874,NewsDesk,"She didn't imply that white men always have it easy.  You may be misreading ""The phenomenon of young white women writing about travel being easy doesnât seem as noticeable to me as young white men doing it."" "
1875,NewsDesk,"I agree wholeheartedly.  I laughed out loud when I read that she was looking forward to the (mostly) non-existent Italian breakfasts.  French ones are better, because of the croissants and bread, but they're still mostly bread, butter, jam and beverage.  ""Food"" for breakfast is popular in England, Australia, NZ, Israel and places that serve buffets (which actually include some Italian tourist hotels).  In all such places, of course, the local breakfast specialties (such as marmite and kippers) may or may not appeal."
1876,NewsDesk,Would this question be asked of male travel writer? 
1877,NewsDesk,"Sally Norton, I agree with Rachel Hayes! would love to hear more from you about your travels. Some of the articles in the Travel Section which focus on staying in what i consider more expensive hotels aren't relevant to what I want. That isn't how you meet the people!<br/>I have a sister in Vienna, a son who worked in Amsterdam, and relatives living in Munich and Italy so most all of my trips have been with local people to guide me to places. New York City, when my son worked there, is where I've been on my own the most. No language barrier there, and had a great time exploring on my own. "
1878,NewsDesk,Yeah you are! Just haven't recognized it yet until this experience. I'm 75 and get comments like NO Way all the time. Never thought myself cool until i retired and started another job after 2 1/2 years of boredom ( you can only clean out so many drawers and flower bed). Work with a fantastic group on late 20's and 30's and a few 50's. They have given me such confidence and comments on my FB page on my birthdays telling me how cool they think I am.  Builds up your confidence for certain! You got this Man!
1879,RealEstate,"I think you should break out NYC into its Boroughs when you write about housing cost.  It is misleading, specially to people who live elsewhere and automatically think of Manhattan and, to some extent, Brooklyn when they hear/see ""New York City"".  "
1880,RealEstate,"This kind of article is an example of the plethora of observations regarding the appreciation of a house's value (or decline), and all these articles are beside the point, which is: <br/><br/>1. You don't purchase a home for its investment potential; you do so for the life it will give you (and your family).<br/><br/>2. You can never sell your home and pocket the money, because you have to live SOMEWHERE.<br/><br/>As to point no. 1, the value that your home has to you is not quantifiable in dollars and cents. It has much more value that is intangible. You may very well purchase a home that isn't quite as forward-looking as another one you've seen, because it appeals to you and your family much more.<br/><br/>As point no. 2, all the while that your home is ""appreciating in double-digit amounts,"" all other homes are usually experiencing the same phenomenon. So, when you're ready to move, retire, or what have you, you will either have to purchase another home, or decide to rent another home. This fact significantly reduces the possibility of cashing-out and walking away with a bundle.<br/><br/>A home is not an asset like a car; it should not be evaluated in a similar way."
1881,RealEstate,"Could this same funky math be used to convert the numbers here to units of bitcoins, banana pellets or jelly beans? Thanks!"
1882,Business,"Considering that social media &amp; much of today's tech was founded by hackers (now Silicon Valley moguls), the privacy issues are no surprise. I am surprised by how gullible the Millennial have been though; life won't be kind to this ill-prepared generation."
1883,RealEstate,That fire escape shelf (in the pictures of the 3rd unit) is a charming novelty and quite a nod to NYC! 
1884,Weekend,If you plan on seeing this film (I am!) -- do yourselves a favor first and tune into her album 'Warm Leatherette'... it's absolutely awesome!!! Time has nothing on Grace Jones!
1885,Weekend,I've seen parts of this - I can't wait to see all of it!!!<br/><br/>Who doesn't love Grace Jones??!!<br/><br/>Yessssss!! 
1886,Weekend,I am sick with delight! I cannot wait to see it this Sunday!
1887,Weekend,We all need a little Grace in our lives. 
1888,Weekend,"Loved the film, especially since I myself was immersed in that NY post-punk scene of Studio 54 and seeing Grace Jones in concert and person. I hadn't read anything about it before and the whole time I was wondering: ""What's with the klutzy cell phones? Are they back?"" Now I know it's older material!!! Not that it matters for the enjoyment of the film. But it is funny that, now for a decade or two, technology, almost more than fashion, gives it all away. I remember my Sony Walkman and my first answering machine the size of a small TV....very fond memories, just like the ones involving the fabulous Grace!"
1889,Weekend,I saw the film. It's brilliant. She is brilliant. This review captures it perfectly. What a completely underrated brilliant beautiful talented powerful woman. Miss Grace Jones.
1890,Weekend,"Can't wait to see this! Grace Jones is one of the most creative and beautiful women of her generation. The video for ""Slave to the Rythm"" is just outstanding. The song one of of my favorites from the 80's era. Thank you Ms. Jones for blowing our minds."
1891,Washington,Reading between the lines. This administration has no real strategy for Syria.  Should it respond militarily or should it refrain?  Its muddled response tells everyone that it is unprepared.
1892,Washington,"Mr. Trump appears to lack an appreciation for the outcomes on those whose lives will be potentially at risk from his unrepressed ego and responses to it: people from all sides, including members of the US military become targets. Trump's tendency to tweet whenever Fox News has a story endangers others while he lives in a hyper-protective cocoon. His lack of military experience and lack of respect for those he is putting into battle are an argument to remove the role of Commander in Chief as part of the outcome of the electoral process."
1893,Washington,"Being coy while controlling a nuclear arsenal capable of destroying the planet. Our nation, the world, deserves better than this. Get him out of there."
1894,Well,"Except, no, that's not the problem. If a product is listed as a food or a drug, then that product must have what the label says it has in it.  Supplements don't have this requirement. Thank you deregulation. It causes all sorts of problems. "
1895,Styles,"Sure, blame the victim. I suppose you would blame children for eating poisoned candy, too. There's no such thing as ""sport fishing,"" and many fish species are endangered more by non-commercial fishing than by commercial fishing. Fish hatcheries are not a solution but instead are a big part of the problem: in addition to being inhumane they release fishes who are not as fit as wild-born fishes but in such numbers that they compete with wild fishes and other native wildlife. Hatcheries also release non-native fishes, further endangering native wildlife. As for plants, there is no credible scientific evidence that they consciously suffer fear or pain or anything else. "
1896,Arts&Leisure,"Yes, I would agree. I left for a few seasons because of the violence but came back and was hooked for the last two seasons. I am sorry to lose my Thursday night appointment, even if it viewed later via On Demand."
1897,Arts&Leisure,"I started the series about season 3 or 4. Preposterous scenarios - but I watch it every week.  In addition to Olivia's clothes, her apartment is lovely.  However, has a scene ever been shot in her dining room?  I had never seen anyone sit at the table. Also - is there a kitchen?  Where does she make her popcorn???"
1898,Arts&Leisure,Passionate sex scenes ? 
1899,Arts&Leisure,"Back in the day, Black women on television were either the angelic mother figure (""Julia"") or the ""sassy"" streetwise gal (""Get Christie Love""). What Rhimes did, thank goodness, was to give TV a much more nuanced Black woman who didn't fit a predetermined mold. Love her or hate her (or somewhere in between) Olivia Pope is a layered Black character who made a huge impact on audiences that had never met her like before."
1900,Arts&Leisure,"never appealed to me. possibly the scripts, or leading actress..."
1901,Arts&Leisure,"""...[G]ood storytelling is good storytelling."" Tell 'em, Shonda!"
1902,Arts&Leisure,What's going to make the upcoming California gubernatorial election interesting is that Democrat candidate Gavin Newsom is a dead ringer for Tony Goldwyn.
1903,Arts&Leisure,"The clothes -- especially Olivia's -- were a character in and of themselves. <br/><br/>As with many other commenters, I loved the first couple of seasons, but then the plot points got just TOO unbelievable and the series lost me as a viewer."
1904,Arts&Leisure,"Long ago I was watching a documentary about Japan and although I don't remember much of the content, a line from the piece stayed with me: ""Many Japanese think American Blacks are exotic.""<br/><br/>Upon hearing and pondering that statement, I thought it sounded right in the truest sense of that word -- of having origins in a distant land. Scandal has been a perfect example of the exotic -- storylines that provoke thoughts like ""wow, they're going in that direction?"" Really an edge-of-the-seat show and one I'll miss terribly, although I'm sure we'll continue to hear from Ms. Rhimes"
1905,Arts&Leisure,"I never watched ""Scandal"" but I love ""How To Get Away With Murder.""  I love the show and Viola Davis rocks!!!"
1906,Arts&Leisure,"I agree completing.  It was must see TV for me for several years, but I haven't watched for years."
1907,Arts&Leisure,"I loved ""Julia"" and the most elegant Diahann Carroll! I so gravitated to her and wished she were my mom. I also fantasized about being a nurse because of her TV character's profession. Btw, for what it's worth, I'm from an unsophisticated midwestern town--and I'm white. For me, ""Julia"" was an eye-opener and it has left a big impression on me all these years later."
1908,Arts&Leisure,I stopped watching when Olivia got kidnapped. Big time jump the shark episodes.
1909,Travel,"I hate when writers attempt to praise a place and then turn around and disparage it for not appealing to some personal whim of theirs.<br/>I hate going to most restaurants today. In catering to the trends, they provide an unpleasant experience. I long for the kinds of restaurants my parents would go to, plush interiors with ""continental cuisine,"" only they don't seem to exist anymore. And where those restaurants could serve 10-page menus, you're lucky today if they have ten items on the menu. It's pathetic."
1910,Travel,"Thanks for this article. Iâm a former Yorkville resident whose heart was broken when I revisited last fall. A walk eastward down 86th St shocked me with all the homogeneous big box names and new, pristine cafes.  The only place still remaining is Papaya King!  When did my old hangout Fitzpatrickâs at 85 and 2nd get replaced?  That joint even turned up in a Seinfeld episode.<br/>When I visit again next week, Iâll bring this guide with me and find those old gems that still remain. "
1911,Travel,"I used to live six blocks from the Candy Shop, and weâd go there all the time.  Best turkey club and vanilla milkshake I know of in Manhattan.  I also always loved the early 90s magazine clippings on the walls.<br/><br/>The one place I would mention that was omitted would be Eats at 75th and Lexington.  The lamb burger there is one of my all-time favorite burgers."
1912,Travel,"The Times needs MUCH more writing by Mr Simonson. Excellent.<br/><br/>And yes, this took me down memory lane too - late after-game dinners and beer with my women's volleyball team at Heidelberg, got serenaded on a second date at Brandy's piano bar (with a Billy Joel song), desperately wanted to eat at Rao's when I worked in East Harlem, lots of Patsys margherita pizza - which I liked best from the refrigerator the next day, romantic dinner at Erminia and leaned too close to the tall candle on the tiny table and set (just a little of) my hair on fire - luckily I had hair to spare and we were sitting near the door so they could air out the burnt hair smell fast - apologized profusely!<br/><br/>Thanks for the brilliant reminder to go back and visit!"
1913,Travel,good article about a hood that has fallen to the so called trendy downtown hoods.. still a lot of old new york in yorkville one just has to look for it.. and that heidelberg food and drink..? definitely coma inducing but oh so good! 
1914,Travel,"I have a confession: a few years ago, as a tourist to NYC, I shopped at Shaller and Weber for a fancy beer stein they have displayed in the window. I bought a huge glass boot along with a few goodies to eat - $75. I paid and hustled my stuff back to my hotel room, then went to dinner.<br/>It wasn't until I got home and looked at my spending that I saw the Shaller cashier had charged me the wrong amount for the stein: $0.75."
1915,Travel,"@Fred:  He also missed the WAIT to get into the restaurant at the Neue Gallerie!  The food may be great, but spending time waiting to get in is not."
1916,RealEstate,Brooklyn IS the city.
1917,RealEstate,She wanted to live in NYC<br/>Sheâs already lived in a more affordable area (Phoenix)<br/>People in other areas of the country can have long commute in their cars to live in an affordable place as well. Salary/finance is all relative.<br/>The comments below judging her potential dating life are just unnecessary and mean
1918,RealEstate,"people move to NYC for dating. that was very honestly noted in this article. people in NYC are much thinner on average than people across the USA. I'm thin, in shape, and have done some low-level modeling, and I am merely average at my gym in NYC. I have lifted weights next to professional athletes and models. it is my theory/belief that the property value in NYC reflect thin people's desire to feel obese zones on the USA. the heavier the USA gets, the more property in NYC will cost. "
1919,RealEstate,"They never explain in these stories how these 20 somethings come-up with the down payment. Yelp's a decent company, but it's not Apple/Google/Facebook/Amazon, where employees routinely sell their stock to come-up with down payments. Also, Yelp moved a lot of operations to Phoenix from the Bay Area so that they could pay employees less - which further deepens the mystery of how she saved-up for a down payment. "
1920,RealEstate,TriBeCa is the city. 
1921,National,"I am a retired teacher from Minneapolis and Saint Paul, Minnesota I taught in both districts for 32 years.  Minneapolis Public Schools faces a $33 million dollar deficit and Saint Paul Public Schools a $l7 million dollar budget cut.  Financial instability creates educational instability with children losing access to counselors, social workers, the arts, music, band, social studies, world languages, etc. Even worse, families flee the inner cities for the suburbs while the cities then struggle with students in high poverty homes. Isn't it time we fixed this mess? Don't our children deserve better? The feds need to fund special education and especially in a time of school violence, social workers in every public school K-12. Teacher strikes are a wake up call to stop the see saw insanity of financial instability."
1922,National,"I can speak little about Oklahoma because I lived in Tulsa once. During the aftermath of the financial meltdown (the Great Recession) I remember State of Oklahoma had to drastically reduce spending which included Education funding. One method of reducing spending was to cut the janitorial staffs of many schools. Parents then stepped in and cleaned the schools! The parents reportedly were happy to do it because it kept the schools open. Now in a booming economy there are rural school districts in Oklahoma, as reported here, that have gone to a four day a week school schedule and have cut foreign language programs  This is the real question...how could the Republicans running this state be so short sighted, they are cutting into their own political viability.  The cuts, affecting the rural students, are placing these rural residents at a clear disadvantage when it comes to being competitive for college admission and competitive for college scholarships.  These Republican lawmakers are instituting an economic divide in the future earning power of these rural kids as they enter the work force and thus further threatening the economic well being of small town Oklahoma.  I imagine (though I do not know) that many of those rural folks vote Republican. I wonder if the parents of these kids have woken up to these facts that their kids are being placed at a clear disadvantage. This hardly makes sense for the future electability. "
1923,National,We donât need more money for public ed. We need to change how it is spent. Slash the billions spent on constant standardized testing and the millions wasted on endless layers of administrators.<br/>Dems need to get behind legislation to tightly control how money is spent. 
1924,National,"Just a perception from the outside, why does it seem that in most parts of the US, education is not deemed a priority or an investment into the future?"
1925,Washington,"Paul Ryan has no conscience.  He has demonstrated this even before he ran for V.P.  The irrefutable proof is the fake TaxReform bill he finagled that busted the budget and gave the vast majority of cuts to the top 1%.  He abandons the country to the inevitable crash of Trumpism, so he can run for President in 2024.  God help us all."
1926,Travel,"And on your scenic trip along the coast, stop and marvel at the geography that makes up Victoria Golf Course that gives Pebble Beach a run for its money. In the summer avoid the tourists with a trip to Cook Street Village right next door to Beacon Hill Park and have a double cheeseburger at Big Wheel followed by and coffee at Moka House. "
1927,Travel,Get to Victoria and visit its beautiful inner harbour before it is destroyed by the inevitable oil tanker spills courtesy of the Kinder Morgan pipeline being built by Alberta.
1928,Travel,"I have been to Victoria twice, and I can say that this is one city for which 36 hours seems about right.  "
1929,Travel,"There are definitely better hotel choices than the Best Western for the money in Victoria. Oak Bay Beach and the Delta at Ocean Pointe are way better, and for similar costs to the BW Plus I would look into the Coast Victoria or the Inn Laurel Point instead. "
1930,Travel,"Missing tea at Murchies (with a newly purchased book from Munros), a chocolate from Rogers and deep breathes in all three - Victoria is a city that delights the nose of book lovers, tea lovers and chocolate lovers. Lunch at Pags. Also, its China Town is older than Vancouver's :) "
1931,Travel,No trip to Victoria is complete without a visit to the Parliament.  It's a historic building and an architectural marvel.  Guided tours are provided by guides dressed up like Queen Victoria.  Both fun and educational.
1932,Travel,"While in Beacon Hill Park, visit the petting zoo which is very popular and features nunmerous animals. A favourite is the miniature goats; the zoo runs the famous goat stampede morning and afternoon, after opening and before closing."
1933,Travel,What?  No visit to the Emily Carr house?  This your first time there?
1934,Travel,"Hi Sid, re-read section 4, Emily Carr House was visited on the trip. I also recommend Craigdarroch Castle and the Restaurant at Oak Bay Marina. But hey, I live here!"
1935,Learning,"I think it is simultaneously the best and worst time to be alive. We have everything at our fingertips: the good, the bad, the useless nothings. We are closer to people who are farther away from us than ever before. But at the same time, we have the highest rate of mental illness, the highest rates of obesity and society seems to become divided more and more each day. People abuse technology, letting it suck them away from the real world and pull them into reality television-toddlers are learning how to hold a phone before they learn to hold a fork.<br/>Although it is for the best that we are more connected to the news, the cost seems to ultimately be turning us oblivious. A quote by Helen Keller goes ""the only thing worse than being blind is having sight but no vision"". People have access to news everywhere-not just in the paper form now but online, on their phones, on television and yet they decide to not go near it, pushing the Instagram app instead of the News app. The only thing worse than having no access to news is having it but disregarding it.<br/>News anchors like Rather are ""taking breaks from the news"", every day people are putting down the newspapers for renovation shows.<br/>It seems impossible to advance our world and make it a better place when we prefer putting our time and efforts into sitting on a couch and flipping to any channel but the news to avoid get senselessly depressed (with all chemicals still balanced) instead of facing the worldâs various problems."
1936,Well,"Did this study take into account things such as drinking, smoking, activities that may have adverse effect on health, and take place more often in the evening (such as barhopping). If you weed out these risk factors, what difference would there be between the roosters and the owls? By the way, I often question the benefit of making âcolumn/byteâ space for all these âhealth pornâ studies. I am reminded of my grandmothers, both of whom were punctual night owls, smoked, worked full-time into their late 70s, and died at age 94 and 96. "
1937,Well,"That is absolutely beautiful, N.<br/>But in tropics and elsewhere, the birds greet the dawn with the most beautiful music, so there is something to hear along with the beauty of a sunrise. Of course, most mornings, on the way to work, there is little birdsong in my vicinity."
1938,Well,"There is a wonderful time at night, when things are darkened and quiet, and you can fully concentrate on your reading or work, with no threat of an interruption in the flow. "
1939,Culture,"While I loved The Sopranos finale, only The Sopranos could pull it off. I hope The Americans doesn't end in such a way.<br/><br/>And I want to see Arkady survive - and flourish."
1940,Culture,"Apparently, three episodes in, we've now reached the end of Act I. <br/><br/>Taking stock:<br/><br/>Philip and Elizabeth are fundamentally on opposite sides (negative). Elizabeth now understands that she hates America and Americans (negative), because it is trying to destroy what she holds most dear (the world of her childhood) (backward looking). (This accounts for the ferocity of her killing spree.)<br/><br/>Philip likes America (positive),  because he sees his future there (forward looking).  He will attempt to prevent Elizabeth from succeeding in her assignment. (conflict)<br/><br/>But the seeds of change have been sown:  Neither having been in contact with the USSR for 20 years:  what would happen if they were?  If Elizabeth should learn that her past is an illusion; or if Philip learns that  his future is a bubble? It could be like something out of an old fairytale where the protagonist returns home after an absence to find everything altered, and falls to dust upon the first contact."
1941,Culture,"My prediction for where the series is heading: Elizabeth taking the cyanide, Philip remaining in the U.S. as a contented American, and Paige either staying with Dad or else following in Mom's spy footsteps."
1942,Culture,"I thought Renee pretended to want to an FBI agent to put Stan off the track that he hasn't yet gotten on to.  'Renee a Russian spy? Oh, no! she's a patriotic American who wanted to help her country.'"
1943,Culture,"Renee..she still raises my suspicions. You donât just announce in the kitchen one evening that you want to be an FBI agent. She also said she admired how P&amp; E âworkedâ together. Iâm stil not sure what side she is on?<br/>It bothers me that Philip has just allowed E to pull Paige into the fold. Maybe Paige will be the ultimate downfall of Elizabeth.<br/>The scene between Oleg and Stan was intense! If Stan would spy on Oleg, this could possibly lead to a Philip sighting.<br/>Every young professional male that  E encounters do not even stand a chance. I just cringe at how ruthless she is.  I realize itâs a tv show, but she doesnât even flinch as she strangles another innocent person."
1944,Culture,"Haskard (play by the underrated Scott Cohen, a great actor) did not see Elizabeth's face. Camera woman is, I believe, spy-colleague Marilyn, or some other ""illegal."" I don't know if Haskard's wife is still alive. Haskard's wife has more than one nurse providing care. Stephanie is one of them."
1945,Culture,"More male victims because more men were in the jobs.  I doubt there were any female Navy security officers guarding the VP's residence  in 1987, or female wheat scientists in the 1980's, or U.S. military Generals, etc."
1946,Culture,I don't trust Renee either.  She has always been a little too convenient.
1947,Obits,Interesting story about a Chinese couple in an effort to preserve historical architecture.  I always find curious about the differences between American style buildings with clear cut &amp; streamlined fashion from those of Chinese buildings in decorative and symmetric style.  But thanks to Lin &amp; Liang that Chinese architecture history keeps forever.  Thanks to NY Times to publish this story.
1948,Games,"Donna, I knew the cable companies except for BET.  HBO is all-pervasive here, and the other two were familiar as well although I don't know why."
1949,Games,"Could be, Babs; it seemed like a reasonable idea  at the time.  I guess xwordinfo could be checked to see if such as UNC, UNH, OSU etc are usually clued as abbrevs.<br/><br/>It may have been designed to mislead solvers such as I into 'open mic'... although 'mic' is an abbrev also, isn't it?<br/>;)"
1950,Games,"Good point. Thanks, Wen."
1951,Games,"""That's one big month ....""<br/><br/>I've used ""big months"" to figure when some date will occur. (Like, suppose we're doing something 12 weeks from today. So add 12x7 to April 12 to get April (12+84) = April 96. Subtracting 30 days for April, we see April 96 = May 66, or since 66 - 31 = 35, June 35. Taking away another 30 days for June shows that April 96 = July 5.)"
1952,Games,I like that!!  A different take on the modulo concept.
1953,Culture,"Interesting thought about when themes are new.  On another theme, I recall feeling years ago at a half-full matinee, how bold and brave the producers of William Hoffman's ""As Is"" were to put something so immediate and energizing and screaming out for action in a commercial production on Broadway.  ""As Is"" being in a big theater, ands running a while, possibly paved the way for some of the still-great work that followed, but somehow the text feels like a snapshot of a distant era now.   (I thought about this not that long ago when I was in a jury pool voir dire with the great actor Lou Liberatore; no one else seemed to recognize him, or his name when it was called, and I wasn't sure whether he'd be pleased or freaked out or neither by a stranger talking to him.)"
1954,Investigative,"How utterly fitting that the consummate ""scandal rag"", The National Enquirer, would be Trump's paper of choice. Does he never bother to read it however, like everything else?"
1955,Investigative,"I 100% support AMI's First Amendment protection, even through it has clearly re-purposed the tabloids as political propaganda vehicles. However, the First Amendment does not protect AMI from criminal campaign finance actions."
1956,Investigative,"Only in America do the rubes think the national inquirer is real news but The NY Times , BBC , CNN , NBC and CBC are fake."
1957,Investigative,"Can someone explain why Donald takes close up photos with the women he later tries to shut down?  A smarter crime boss would have a goon bash the camera to bits and shoo off the photographer.  But Donald lives for the media.  And some of the media lives for Donald.  <br/><br/>However, the notion that the National Enquirer is quite ""the press"" contemplated in the First Amendment is the one of the silliest things I've read in a long time.  New York money isn't really very street savvy, is it?"
1958,Investigative,"The First Amendment has no bearing when a news organization buys a story to silence its teller through contractual nondisclosure provisions. A publisher can of course publish outlandish tripe within the bounds of the First Amendment and libel laws, but it canât use the shining sword of free speech to cut the throat of someone with newsworthy information. Freedom of expression is not freedom of suppression. "
1959,Investigative,"What about Sinclair, FOX, Breitbart ?  They also seem to be very connected to Trump, they report consistently pro-Trump contrary to facts &amp; evidence, and they've ramped up the political coverage during the campaign.  Shouldn't FBI be looking at them too, as unreported campaign activities?  (And to be fair, also any publications that might be doing the same for the Dems?)  "
1960,Investigative,Really?   The feds break down doors for this?   All citizens should be afraid.
1961,Investigative,"Many of the paths that law enforcement have ultimately proceeded down only came into sharp focus after prosecutorial agencies initially satisfied a probable cause standard. The broader investigation of wrongdoing, encompassing all law enforcement agencies now covers payments to pornographic actress, the finances of Trumpâs lawyerâs taxicab business and tapes made of an appearance on âAccess Hollywood.â While the low burden of probable cause isnât assigned a specific percentage of evidence, some cases have described it as being in the range of 30 to 40%. Mueller also has no less than 15 of the countryâs best prosecutors on the case, viewing every single piece of evidence with eye toward ultimately obtaining a conviction.<br/><br/>In the Trump investigation, any actual indictments will be kept under seal, ensuring for the time being that thereâs no public oversight to any findings that are reached. Many (but not all) of the top politicians representing the American people have become very wealthy over the years (the average congress member being worth close to 8 million dollars in 2011) and are invariably involved in large, complex business deals and financial structuring. Would every single top ranking Democrat business deal survive such a wide-ranging investigation where additional paths of inquiry only required probable cause, subject to no public scrutiny? Itâs possible they would, but I wouldnât bet my own money on it.  And I say this as a life-long Democrat who voted for Hillary."
1962,Investigative,"So, are you saying that you find Trump and the NE appealing?"
1963,Investigative,I was thinking the same thing
1964,Investigative,I used to buy the world and see where bat Boy had been found. It was a fun read. When I was supporting 8 soldiers during the war I would send them copies too. Mindless silliness.   I never have bought the NE nor People magazine but many years ago it was just fun. 
1965,Investigative,Put Sinclair Media in there as well.  Many moons ago there were restrictions in how many news outlets one company or individual could own.   Maybe that should be revisited.  
1966,Investigative,"And the fake news advocates speak up. Trump's collusion and skulduggery runs deep and wide. He must be exposed on all levels, including violations of campaign finance law. Supporting Trump doesn't make you a target; violating laws does."
1967,Investigative,"Opinion has bias, analysis has bias, there are multiple sides to interpretations of the objective facts.  The truth has no side, it simply is. Data, evidence has no side, it simply is. <br/><br/>I believe all of the publishers know this but some consider the truth, objective indisputable fact, to be an obstacle to overcome in the pursuit of their agenda.  If you publish facts truthfully and they  reflect badly on the person being discussed, that is not bashing, that is honest reporting.  If you publish lies, half truths, or misrepresentations, that is not reporting, it is something else entirely."
1968,Washington,"Mr Trump needs to give up his children's morning TV show for a while and read a legitimate newspaper or two. <br/><br/>Also, to leave Mr. Pecker alone and seek other forms of entertainment."
1969,Washington,How often does it have to be said?<br/>Trump is just doing what he promised his voters and what he was elected for - to destroy the US government. 
1970,OpEd,"And we made it far too simple for them by holding a rigged primary, putting up a deeply flawed but feel good candidate. lets control what we can control instead flailing against inevitable racism and constitutional  law. ."
1971,Foreign,"I'm skeptical but the French have confirmed the use of chemical weapons.  Please don't make this into something political.  The Syrian people are being slaughtered by the three headed monsters, Iran, Syria and Russia and the ""free"" world is doing nothing.  This is not Iraq.  A country who did nothing to provoke a horrible war which continues."
1972,Foreign,"Any civilian casualty is a tragedy. However, in your zeal to condemn the United States you omit a significant fact. This chemical attack was deliberately made upon innocent civilians with the specific intent to kill or poison them.Concversely, the United States goes to greater lengths than any other country to aviod civilian casualties.Sometimes, strikes directly on military targets are avoided because of potential civilian harm. No other country does this. There is no moral equivilancy between Syria's systematic and deliberate intent to kill its own civilians, and US military action designed to avoid or minimze such tragedies. Sadly, war is war, and in any war thousands of innocents will suffer.   "
1973,Foreign,"Alan Mass: Inspectors from the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons are set to arrive in Damascus to start an investigation into the chemical attack. They are not due to visit the site of the incident until Saturday, however.<br/>Above from The Guardian.UK"
1974,Foreign,"In reply to Magnar Husby of Norway comment: The article does not claim proof. It merely provides reports of eyewitness accounts. Further, are you genuinely that concerned about journalistic standards? Do you really think these photos and videos are staged? "
1975,Business,Zuckerberg's up and coming business was fronted by the Russians along with Twitters. Both platforms have been and are being used to attack and manipulate the American population.  Zuckerberg is in collusion with the Russians and the only reason he is back pedaling is because people are leaving FaceBook in hoards.
1976,Business,"In spite of the justifiable outrage (both real and feigned), what surprises me continually is how many people really don't care who has access to a wealth of data about them.  I guess it's par for the course for the Reality TV age, when even what once upon a time would have been the most private and guarded details are now willing fodder for public consumption, as long as it gets someone more attention. "
1977,Business,"Facebook has made a fortune by stealing people's personal property and selling it to every stripe of merchant and criminal to use against them.  In the process he fired every employee who argued that he was betraying what he kept proudly portraying as a goal of ""bringing people together.""<br/><br/>Zuckerberg and his cronies belong in jail.  "
1978,Sports,I give full credit to the new manager who has a great team and knows how to truly manage all of them.  
1979,Sports,Mets have looked great until after the all star break so many times that it's hard to be optimistic but for some reason I still root for them.
1980,Dining,"If Olive Garden can pass itself off as ""Italian"" then Hernandez can do whatever he wants. Food that simply tastes good is not a bad thing. Hats off to Hernandez. "
1981,Dining,"Did you read the article, David?  Eddie doesnât care."
1982,Dining,"I haven't even read this article yet, but I had this guy's collard greens last year at Southern Foodways. They were THE BEST COLLARDS EVER! Actually they might have been mustard or turnip. What do I know? Not much, except that they were good! Haha, just saw the title of the book. Looks like I guessed wrong. Turnip it is!"
1983,Dining,Isnât this a textbook example of cultural appropriation? A Hispanic man is stealing food ideas from Americans. I canât think of a more perfect example of stealing oneâs culture. <br/><br/>Note- I think cultural appropriation is a ridiculous concept. But the zealots who espouse it should have no trouble deeming Mr. Hernandez a problematic person who should not steal the culture of others 
1984,Dining,I don't care that chef Eddie Americanizes recipes. I actually like the way taco bell tacos taste--but I don't think of them as tacos.<br/>I'll bet his food is good as tasty food but NOT as what it's called.
1985,Dining,Nice tip from the chef on blistering the jalapenos in oil to take away the green taste and using lemon juice instead of lime for guacamole. 
1986,Dining,"Oh please, you're telling me you've never had Queso made with Velveeta in Texas?"

1990,Culture,John's Roast Pork. End of story. 
1991,Culture,"You know, I'm usually pretty accepting when it comes to new and unusual musical ideas and work. (Doing electronic and experimental music in the 1970s will have that effect on a person.) I don't even have any problems with including ""non-musical"" sounds in musical sound art, even the sounds of a sizzling grill. Heck, I taught electronic music techniques for years.<br/><br/>But, c'mon, now... Does it actually matter that the recorded sizzling came from steak that would eventually make into a particular kind of sandwich? Or that the sound was recorded at a particular shop in a particular city? Or that THIS recording is the most magnificent and perfect ever of frying steak about to be placed into a sandwich?"
1992,Culture,I thought question about how Philly cheesesteak got to Carnegie Hall had an easy answer: practice. 
1993,Culture,"THANK YOU!!!! I came to Philadelphia not because of the EAGLES or the Cheesesteaks. I came for the oldest museum and art school in America. I came for one of the best museums in America, I came for the amazing public art, I came for the brilliance that has been and is Philadelphia.  This city has one of the largest park systems in America with thousands of sounds and stone bridges that look the same as they did 150 years ago, we have so many stories, from the first papermill in America down the street with  me, leading me to thousands of acres of forest, within the city. And a greasy sandwhich is what this guy is interested in?  Why do we have to dumb it all down? imagine if art mattered to most people as much as sports and cheesesteaks. The composer is not from Philadelphia, that is clear. Most of us in the arts would agree. "
1994,Upshot,"The dual mandates of the FED, set in the Federal Reserve act of 1977, are inflation and employment.<br/>In defense of the FED, the mandates require them to lower interest rates when employment is threatened.<br/>We may call these moves ""puts"", but the real culprit is Congress adding employment to the responsibility of the FED in 1977."
1995,Upshot,Mr. Kudlow is a TV personality. He is not an economist (degree in History); he is not a venture capitalist or banker (fired from BearSterns 25 years ago due to his coke habit); he has been consistently wrong on his economic and stock market predictions. He is a supply side hot air blower and he is blowing it you know where.
1996,Upshot,"Quoting Paul Krugman: ""The stock market is not the economy..."" To quote my financial mentor: ""Trading is not investing, it's speculating..."" <br/><br/>Yet, we look at the market indicators as though they are the national economy itself. Of course the traders are nervous. <br/><br/>The reality is that there is more at stake than the value of stocks if/when a trade war is launched. Often times they are the precursor to all-out war. <br/><br/>Unfortunately, our President sees the world as one massive real estate gamble with all the bluff, bluster and threats he used all of his life. Sad for us there is a lot more at stake.<br/><br/>Sadder still are the wealthy who basically own the legislature being all too quiet as the war drums start beating all over the planet. Perhaps we are just suicidal or delusional - probably both."
1997,Upshot,in all fairness I think that the level of the vix last year was an aversion
1998,Climate,"Pruitt, like most of the HYPOCRITES in the Republican Party are all ""lock them up"", "" we need hearings"" whenever a Democrat makes even a minor mistake.  With lying faux Fox ""news"" trumpeting the same 24/7.<br/><br/>In Oklahoma, as attorney general Pruitt was completely in the Oil Industry's pocket.  He did their bidding under the guise of 'MOGA' only it did not improve things in OK.  Now as dismantler in chief of the EPA he's doing his damndest to roll back everything beneficial the EPA has accomplished over the past 25 years.  A paid in full tool of the Koch Bros and Mercer / Trump ruinous agenda.<br/><br/>Pruitt has such an inflated sense of entitlement that he's wasting tens of thousands of tax payer dollars on inessential trappings and a potentate's security detail.  If ever a rotten politician warranted ""hearings"" and locking up, its Scott Pruitt!<br/><br/>How about a special prosecutor for Pruitt's activities as well as Ryan Zinke's bad acting at the Dept. Of Interior.<br/><br/>Too bad Trey 'Benghazi' Gowdy, devious Devin 'no nothing' Nunez and spineless Paul Ryan and the KY Turtle aka Mitch McCONnell all have ""other priorities"" (like Dick Cheney did with his five deferments to avoid military service).<br/><br/>VOTE Them OUT.    And lock THEM up!"
1999,Climate,"Almost as sleazy as Trump.  But, he's younger, he can catch up.<br/>   SAD."
2000,Climate,"That Pruitt is fighting to benefit polluting companies financially at the expense of Americans medically should wipe away the illusion that Trump cares about the average guy, but alas, the right-wing bubble, where the fringe has become main-stream, will defend Pruitt as a ""good man,"" and the target of a left-wing conspiracy to bring him down. Sigh..."
2001,Climate,"I agree that using taxpayer money to advertise a private company's product overseas is worse, but don't soft-pedal the rental scam. Pruitt did not pay $1500 per month because he only paid for the nights he was actually there, even though he retained access to the room. Imagine if you got 2/3 off of your rent or mortgage because you're not there during the day! Also, $1500 for a townhouse in Capitol Hill is severely discounted, even if Pruitt had paid that."
2002,Climate,"You are right, the really horrible mess is the rape of our environmental protections that Pruitt is carrying out."
2003,National,"He is not  a good governor , therefore he would be a terrible senator .<br/>His past is not limpid , made his money through a huge fraud to Medicare .<br/>He would probably be against Medicare , Social Security and everything for average Americans to favore the top 1% .<br/>He is a climate change denier, while so many beaches in Florida are sinking in the Atlantic and Gulf .<br/>Donât vote for him this November !"
2004,National,"The expression goes ""House guests and fish begin to stink after three days"". Well, governors, especially reactionary GOP governors, begin to stink after two terms.  This race between Scott and Nelson isn't going to be nearly as close as the media would have you believe. "
2005,National,Perhaps they can now find out how his company was fined the the largest amount in US history for defrauding the government and he was let off with a $300 million golden parachute.
2006,National,"""Republicans, for their part, are targeting...  Representative Stephany Murphy of Orlando.""<br/>Because it's a gimme that Stephany Murphy, a Blue Dog Democrat, will win in the Democratic Primary, where she is opposed by the progressive Chardo Richardson. How could it be otherwise? "
2007,National,How on earth could anyone from Puerto Rico campaign for Scott or any Republican? It is shameful. 
2008,National,There is also the Puerto Rican factor.  Puerto Ricans that moved to Florida after the hurricane have voting rights on the mainland.  They will not forget how they were treated by the republicans.
2009,National,"From where I sit in Central Florida the Republican Party is in as much disarray as the Dems, plus they have controlled Tallahassee for 8 years while state services have been in steep decline. So, donât count out people just voting âDâ in November."
2010,Insider,"This article exemplifies the wish stated in the final paragraph. It describes a phenomenon that we all experience without thinking about; the search for deeper meaning in our reading material. <br/><br/>For example, if I read an article about, say, a White Nationalist in Ohio (""A Voice of Hate in America's Heartland"" 11/25/17), I'm ostensibly reading it because I'm curious about how a White Nationalist would describe himself to a writer reporting from a nonjudgmental angle. I'm aware of my curiosity and grateful to hear opinions I don't agree with presented ""as is,"" without implying that I should disapprove or approve of them. But underlying my curiosity is the desire to better understand how the world fits together; how could someone who genuinely believes in the superiority of white people and I live in the same world?<br/><br/>This article helps me understand how writers make stories interesting, not just based on their factual content, but also by drawing seemingly unrelated elements together to make a whole that is larger than the sum of its parts.<br/><br/>I believe that people are interested in understanding the big picture, which we construct with bits of information. We rarely question why something is interesting to us, or why we accept one story and reject another. I think this article helps elucidate the process by which we make sense of the world."
2011,Foreign,"I attended the same university soon after her death. This alleged rapist stayed in his position. I feel chills down my spine, not just because he might have taught my friends, but because I did not hear about this until now. How much more academic exploitations do students have to take to fully justify the #metoo movement there?"
2012,Well,"Are we going to spend some time exploring what caused the increasing incidence? Is it environmental, is it something in our food... we should look closely at the why of it"
2013,Well,"There are much, much cheaper alternatives to the Epipen; don't let the Mylan reps. below scare you into buying the brand name!!"
2014,Well,"Parkinson's disease is correlated to exposure to Manganese.  I know.  There were several neighbors (no relation who lived across the street from eachother)  in an exclusive neighborhood in Los Altos Hills, California who all developed Parkinson's disease.  Their disease killed them all.  The only possible epidemiological cause is from heavy metal poisoning from soil which was previously used for farming.  "
2015,Well,"This drug has been approved in Canada and apparently costs less there. One article I saw quoted CA$ 224 exclusive of dr. admministration fees. As of a couple of months ago, applications were pending in Australia, Japan and Europe. so by now they may have been approved and if you have travel to one of these places in your future you might want to consider getting at least your first shot there.<br/><br/>I wasn't aware but it has apparently been common for some Americans to get expensive vaccinations (like Zostavax) abroad in places like France,where they cost less."
2016,Well,"Having had shingles on the right side of my face, and ultimately in my mouth, when I was 59, I can testify to the agonizing pain it produces.  No kind of pain-killer, vicodin or otherwise, will stop the shooting, stabbing pain from the nerve ending on the skin to the brain.  I had the post-herpetic neuralgia for more than 6 months, and at time, still feel tingling.  Fortunately, it didn't get to my eye.  I got the Zostavax vaccine as soon as I could afterward.  ( I had actually asked for the vaccine six months before I got shingles, but was told my insurance wouldn't cover it until I was 60.)  <br/><br/>The message I want to convey here is not really about the shingles vaccination, but to address the jeopardy that parents, based on a charlatan's admittedly false research, put their children in when they don't vaccinate them against chicken pox.  They are condemning them to a one in three chance of developing an excruciatingly painful condition in the future."
2017,Well,"I have a friend, in his sixties, who was always doctor-phobic.  He wouldn't see a physician unless dragged to do so by wild horses.  A few years ago, he came down with a rash pain so agonizing that he actually went to the emergency room.  Diagnosis: shingles.  And while at the hospital my friend was also diagnosed with diabetes.   "
2018,Well,I had a mild case of shingles last August. Is it safe for me to have the new vaccine now?
2019,Well,"I was fully covered by the private insurance I purchase here in California due to the Affordable Care Act (Thanks President Obama). I am trying to complete as much preventive health care as I can since I have no idea of what next year may bring (Thanks President Trump). <br/><br/>There is absolutely no reason why ANY American citizen should have to pay for this basic type of preventive care. None, whatsoever. Vaccinations such as these should be available and free to all who seek it."
2020,Well,"Claiming an ""acid stomach"" to be a side effect of a Shingrix vaccination is anecdotal, or a study where N is 1."
2021,Well,"My CVS plan covers me and I have a low cost plan which will cover me for the 2, 2 months apart necessary vaccines with an out of pocket total of $80 "
2022,Well,"I am a pharmacist and like Zostavax, Shingrix is covered under Medicare Part D."
2023,Well,"<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emma_Walmsley"" title=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emma_Walmsley"" target=""_blank"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emma_Walmsley</a><br/><br/>Here's where you can read more about GlaxoSmithKline's new CEO -- longtime l'Oreal beauty exec Emma Walmsley.  She states  her objective at GSK  is ""to commercialise more drugs.""  I guess not surprising when you've spent your previous professional life hawkinbg eye creams, night serums, mascara and the like."
2024,Well,"I remember my grandmother (who died in 1979 at age 93) having a bad case of shingles; my mother did as well in approximately 1975.  The chickenpox vaccine was not available at that time and all of us kids had chickenpox, so shingles was definitely around regardless of the exposure.   "
2025,Well,Same in BC Canada.
2026,Well,"But if this vaccine lives up to its promise, simply because it is a blockbuster drug for GlaxoSmithKlein does not discount the advisability of getting it.  However, since the market is so big in the US, all the more reason for some price control on drugs, for example allowing the government to bargain on the cost of drugs for Medicare beneficiaries, a huge market for the vaccine."
2027,Well,"I asked my CVS to order it, and they refused, claiming that the shot was not recommended for people under 50. I'm 48. I asked them what to do in the meantime. They said, ""Stay away from people who have it."" "
2028,Well,"My doctor didn't mention it when I was there for my checkup in late November. After reading this article, I went and got the first shot without a prescription or co-pay at my local supermarket pharmacy. "
2029,Well,"Nancy, This sounds horrible. Maybe they weren't aware when you were immunized that the old vaccine ""starts to lose its protection after three years."" According to this, you would not have been immune in 2017/18."
2030,Well,You'll be out the full $5K if you get shingles this year.
2031,OpEd,"Responding to ""Econ191"" from Dallas: what makes you think getting the government out of student loans would make colleges take on the loan risk? What would really happen is we go back to how things were before: a separate, highly privatized loan industry. Tuition stays high but we'd have higher rates for students and more predatory lending practices.<br/><br/>These private lenders would be a drag on our economy by skimming off of - and holding back - the most promising new prospects joining our economy each year."
2032,OpEd,There are many disqualifying conditions making one ineligible for military service. To use just one example; someone with poor eyesight is not allowed to enlist and then provided medical services to 'correct' the condition. Why should those with 'gender dysphoria' be treated any differently? 
2033,OpEd,"The military is not interested in your ""openness and happiness.""  The military is interested in your lethality.  Don't muddy the issues."
2034,Learning,"In this picture, There are two women with birds hair blow dryers drying. Itâs looks like chickens. They seem to be in a dark place with metal roofing. One of the girls look like indian because her name is Divya and its an indian name. I think they get them ready to be turned into taxidermy. I can also see that they are in the very dark room and there are more people."
2035,Learning,In this picture It looks like 2 women using hair dryers to dry birds of some sort. They may be preparing them for maybe some type of clothing. The birds look skinned which leads me to believe that they are being used for something.
2036,Learning,"More than one bird, must have used the flash the background is dark but the birds and the two ladies are a bit bright except for the one sitting down in the back."
2037,Learning,i think chickens dead :(
2038,Learning,I think that these women are drying the dead birds in order to pluck them if their feathers. I originally thought they were rescuing the birds but they appear to be dead so I think theyâre going to use them for some sort of good or clothing.
2039,Learning,"These chickens are getting blow dried maybe after being washed, in a warehouse setting."
2040,Learning,Iâm not sure what is going on in this picture because it looks like two people drying the fur of either looks like dead birds with a blow-dryer in order to preserve it 
2041,Learning,"Two women, dry chicken feathers with blow dryers.  One of the hair dryers has the word, or name, Divya in all caps written on her dryer. This could either be her name, or the hair dryerâs logo. The chicken feathers theyâre holding appear to be from chickens that arenât living. The things I see to make me say that, are the dryers the women are holding. A couple more things I notice about this photo, are the fact that theyâre in a warehouse, which could mean that there are many more chickens they have to blow dry. Thereâs also the fact that itâs dark, which may mean theyâve been there for a while. There does seem to be a man in the background, but I donât really know if heâs really important to the situation though."
2042,Learning,1.	The people just finished washing birds and are now drying them.<br/>2.	They have hairdryers and birds.<br/>3.	There is a name on the hairdryer and they seem to be in some sort of shack.
2043,Learning,Two women are blowing drying chickens with a hair dryer. It seems to be in modern time due to the hair dryer being in the picture and the darker skinned womanâs earrings. They donât seem old fashioned. Sheâs holding a hair dryer that has the name âDIVYAâ written on it in black capital letters. There is a person watching them in the background who is a very dark shadow. The ceiling has red beams going across it making it like a factory type scenery and with items all over the tables in the background. 
2044,Learning,"These birds or chickens could either be dead or being washed based on a natural disaster. If theyâre dead, these women are likely using their fur to make clothes based on fur and more. Thereâs a hair dryer that is Divya and could lead to a hint of a certain hair dryer to dry off a certain material."
2045,Learning,Two ladies are washing the birds to try to save them. They got into a oil spill and almost died.
2046,Learning,I think that the chickens is stunned and they are having a very nice grooming and getting them all fixed up so they can live again. Maybe they're dead and they are taking off they feathers and they can sell the feathers in stores.
2047,Learning,"These two characters in this photo are drying of poultry so they can cook them later. These figures are most likely go to either eat the poultry for themselves, or they are going to give the food to the homeless and others who need food. it seems that they also have done this many times before because of the way that they are drying of the poultry and the way the room they are in is formed. They have the materials they need and are ready for whatever they must do."
2048,Learning,The two women in this picture are blowdrying chickens and I'm unsure as to why they are. One of the women had what I assume to be their name on the hair dryer. The chickens seem to be in pain.
2049,Learning,"In this picture, two women appear to be blow drying chicken skins.  I believe they are skinning the chickens to prepare them for the stuffing process.  Then they will be either sold at a taxidermy shop or placed in a museum for an exhibit.  When I look closer at this picture, I see that the women have already removed all of the meat from the inside of the chicken, further leading me to believe that they will eventually end up in a taxidermy shop or museum."
2050,Learning,"In this photo, there are two women. The woman closer to the camera seems to be younger than the one in the background. I think these girls may be Hispanic, or at least the one closer to the camera. Both of these girls are drying off birds with a hairdryer. The girl in the front has a white hair dryer with the word Divya written on it which could possibly be her name. I believe that these girls have cleaned these birds and they are now drying them off. I can't really tell if these birds are alive or not because they seem limp and the bird that the girl in the front has is showing a bunch of bare skin like the feathers is missing. I think that these people work with animals often because the girl in the front is wearing earrings that have a bat and a heart on them which makes me think she loves animals or loves working with them."
2051,Learning,is that a chicken?? 
2052,Learning,"In this picture it appears that two people are blow drying dead birds. It looks like birds because of the feet, head, and feathers. They might be planning to use the feathers for something."
2053,Learning,"With an optimistic and positive viewpoint: There is two women who are seem to be blow drying some birds, which could be birds that were hurt by maybe an oil spill or some disaster (which is not really positive but..), and they are cleaning them up and drying them so they can be set free... They are inside of a building/warehouse going based off the walls, with low lighting. But it could also be a place where they use animals for cosmetic/fashion reasons and they are just trying to clean up the feathers for some fashion use."
2054,Learning,In this picture it looks like two women are blow drying birds. They must be working at a shelter to help animals and give care. They could possibly be dead or they could have been rescued. 
2055,Learning,delicious chickens getting ready to be eaten and sold at a farmers market in toronto and in the photo the chickens are being prepped. The blow dryers are to heat the chicken up enough to pluck the feathers with ease and the people in the back are waiting to bring the newly cleaned chickens out to be sold or cooked.   
2056,Learning,"In this picture there is two woman who are blow drying the chickens head for a chicken show.The woman are blow-drying the chickens , because they just gave their chickens a bath so they can look very clean for the chicken show.But also the woman might be drying the chickens because they got wet in the rain,and also because they don't have anything to dry the chickens.     "
2057,Learning,"Since the letters on the girl in the frontâs hairdryer is written in glitter glue, I donât think they are purposely hurting the chicken.  Maybe they are helping dry the chickens for their feathers "
2058,Learning,I think these birds are no longer alive and the women drying the birds are looking to use the feathers for some sort of design or product. 
2059,Learning,It looks like the lady is drying a bird. The bird may have been washed and now she is drying it. Maybe this bird was stuck in an oil spill and is being clean.
2060,Learning,"I think that in this picture these two ladies have dead birds. I think that they was the birds and are now drying them in order to use their feathers. I notice they don't have gloves or any gear that would may protect them from guts and blood, so you can assume that they are going to marinate them or something. The birds are also hanging. Birds don't do that unless they are dead. They don't hang or droop they typically like to stay upright. The clearer bird to the right can be seen as cut open. Their stomachs don't work like that they have feather all over their bodies without bare bellies. In the background you can see another person a man. You can see and table a type of contraption that has the role of string on it that could be used to make jewelry and other accessories. Everything in the picture is realistic. The first thing you do notice is the name on the hair dryer. Once you start to look at the background it becomes clear that this isn't a factory or a warehouse, it looks like a store, workshop, or even home where these people work, make, and sell jewelry. Her name is on it which means that she must work there. The texts suggests that there are more people with different hair dryers. The Lady on the left is wearing a scarf which makes her very casual. The girl on the right has a ring on her finger and large earrings also suggesting a casual setting. Therefore these ladies are people who use the birds feathers to make jewelry."
2061,Learning,I believe they're drying props for a photo shoot or scene set area since there's cake behind them  unless this is some unknown way to kill a small animal I mean everything is possible 
2062,Learning,"In this picture there are two females that are holding birds. I feel that they are trying to cook the bird with a hair dryer (Which isn't very safe). I think this because the female in the front is holding a bird, and there is no feathers on the bottom of the bird. This makes me think the bird may be dead or it could be the exact opposite, and they are trying to help the birds by keeping them warm. "
2063,Learning,A group of poor income people who dry their clothes by a hairdryer. I am assuming they are poor because of the dark room and ripped clothes and how they have to use a hairdryer for clothes
2064,Learning,There is 2 women apparently blow drying some sort of fluffiness in their hands and the blow dryer has a name on it. This looks like it could be for some sort of play that they are getting ready to presents because it seems like they could be wearing costumes.
2065,Learning,"I agree, I think you had a great thought about the chickens being taken care of for a fair or show for which one is the biggest. "
2066,Learning,Good inference relating the name on the hair dryer to a taxidermy company. I agree with your comment. Great job!
2067,Styles,Just stop with dredging up one negative moment in Galliano's life as if that defines him. Enough is enough. The man is a sartorial genius and one of the few truly original voices in fashion. To this day.  
2068,Styles,Can't wait to never ever again see Jenner/Kardashians on the cover of Vogue. 
2069,Styles,If this is true how about Michelle Obama as her replacement?
2070,Styles,"Wow, âpretty much every conversation sheâs had in the last seven daysâ.....<br/>has been about this woman? "
2071,Styles,"Is it also conceivable that she is the Doyenne of Mediocrity? MAtch my painterâs eyeâlikewise 68 yearsâ worthâwhich sees nothing in her that is truly artisticâyes, lots of money everywhere, yet year after year, boring uninspired design in her protegesâ collection, grotesque graphic deaign with an unforgivable ignorance of typography, let alone interesting photography, and the models? Dull and uninspiring. Give me one model in the last 40 years that has the spirit and innocence of Bettina. Or the sexual maturity of a Dovima or Suzy Parker? And the Met galas are just de trop. Most of all itâs the lack of allure in this whole businessâVreelandâs favorite wordâallure. You have to be a true artist to make the eye travel. Bore, bore, bore! Itâs not the dresses that got small, itâs the people."
2072,Styles,"I doubt many people will miss her, will be nice not to see an article with her name in it though, that's a good thing"
2073,Styles,This rumor is probably not true but Wintour should absolutely step down.  Vogue has been formulaic and dull for well over a decade and the magazine really needs a new editor.  
2074,Styles,"I am always amused by the obsession with vanity and how it is dressed as high art and sophistication. Preening, pretentious peacocks, the whole lot.  Who cares if the color in the bargain bin began its life on a Paris catwalk. Silly people in a serious world..........getting rich off child labor. Gives you a warm fuzzy feeling, don't ya think?"
2075,Styles,"These fashion elites mean absolutely nothing to anyone who is not in their ethnocentric orbit.  We gawk and giggle at them as if they were sideshow exhibits at the circus.  Afterwards we just shake our heads and say, ""bless their hearts."""
2076,Styles,"Good, and may the door slam her as she is leaving. Wintour is almost single handily responsible for bring fur back into acceptability. To say she has blood on her hands is no understatement. We all know the torture creatures live through so that their fur becomes a draped garment, and yet Wintour wears that cruelty as a badge. Wintour is so last century."
2077,Styles,Rumor or not I suspect that the various fashion houses are all a clatter with the sound of knives sharpening.
2078,Styles,Hopefully a world without Anna at Vogue will not include the Kardashians and Jenners in its cover anymore. I cancelled my subscription the month she made KK and Kanye her cover models. I go to US Weekly for those type of articles... 
2079,Styles,It's very unhealthy for any organization to allow one (mortal) individual to exercise so much influence regardless of that individual's talent or creativity.
2080,Styles,"Oh, we do appreciate beauty but, we all have other things to do."
2081,Styles,And not a single speck of it is worth even half the price.  <br/><br/>Not. Even. Half.  <br/><br/>Overpriced and overvalued.  <br/><br/>Just like Wintour. 
2082,Styles,"A ""champion of civility""?  <br/><br/>That's funny. <br/><br/>I think you need to go look up the definition of ""civility"";  the effect Anna Wintour has on those around her could hardly be defined as ""civil"", but nice try.  "
2083,Styles,Well said.
2084,Styles,Because this particular figure rules over a huge industry. Perhaps you should check out the 'blue sweater' scene in The Devil Wears Prada. 
2085,Styles,"Right, like Allure?  I cancelled my subscription to Allure after a younger, more modern editor took over.  The magazine is now taken over by foul mouthed twits who can't spell correctly.  No thanks."
2086,Styles,"If YOU don't care for it, don't read it; please don't presume to speak for more than one NYT reader."
2087,Styles,"Couldnât agree more. Iâm sick of the Kardashianâs. Vogue was once about real high fashion and the designers. Now, itâs about ppl just out of their teens taking up entire issues. Please bring back the beauty in models and clothing we had years ago. Miserable looking models and designs that are hideous fill the mag and online content. You donât have to be wealthy to enjoy excellent design.  Nearly all the content is about celebrities, mostly quite young, wearing unsightly clothing one wouldnât wear if they could afford it. I will not be renewing my subscription. PS: Who pays for the clothing and accessories? Not the 18-25 yr olds; parents pay. How about considering 35-50 yr old women who pay for their clothing themselves and want something truly elegant and no âreal furâ thank you."
2088,Styles,"Ms. Wintour has had, and continues to have, an incredible impact upon the world of art, fashion, and culture. I am excitedly anticipating the future voices that will be heard after her departure, and seeing the work of the individuals that are inspired by Vogue. We can all agree that Trump has negatively upended our world, but there is still expression, speech, art, and culture, and acknowledgement of those who have done intrepid work to preserve that. "
2089,Styles,"Oh, please. <br/><br/>Anna Wintour could hardly be described as ""intrepid"".  "
2090,Styles,"All the so-called immortals are now six-feet under and soon she will be one of them (both metaphorically and literally).  Vogue America has been so corporate, so insular, so myopic and so boring for so long, it's a wonder people still read it.  I am very much into fashion, art and design but I've stopped buying it 20 years ago and don't feel I've missed anything. "
2091,Magazine,Trump is a narcissist and a vast open pit of need. The rallies are his fix.
2092,Magazine,"Here is the life of Trump.<br/><br/>1.  Get up and pretend to work as president (i.e., figure out how to milk this cash cow). <br/><br/>2. Go back to bed, eat fast food and watch Fox News tell me how great I am and what I should think.<br/><br/>3. Hold rallies so my few remaining supporters (Do they come in costume or just look weird? Sad.) can pump up my ego.<br/><br/>4.  Get up and pretend to work as president (i.e., figure out how to milk this cash cow)."
2093,Magazine,"It's painfully clear that the segment of American society that attends Trump rallies and dotes on him represents exactly what Hillary Clinton was referring to when she used the term ""deplorable."" But his other supporters, such as his lawyers and cabinet members in the White House, are equally deplorable. "
2094,Magazine,"He feels empowered when he is scamming people, grifting or just selling stuff. The rallies are Trump commercials. MSM TV  should never carry the rallies live<br/>but just view them as infomercials packed with scams. They should just show clips with factual subtitles.  The more Trump plays the media the more misinformed Americans become, dangerous for all."
2095,Magazine,Why did PT Barnum keep his museum open even though many had convinced themselves they knew his tricks?  Because there's one born every minute.
2096,Magazine,He still holds rallies because that's what strongmen or strongmen wannabes do. It makes them feel better because they don't have the intellectual fortitude or the real support of ALL of  their constituents. It makes them feel good and strong. 
2097,Magazine,"Ignorance seems to be the hallmark of the presidency, whatever sounds good like non-existent WMDs or trickle down wealth that never flows. Why not an entertainer? Obamaâs current arc seems to be one of a man who loves adulation, cleverly sidestepping his crackdown on immigration and the pain it caused, teeing up for some kind of media role. Americaâs love for hucksters is vast, with fingers crossed that they wonât press any buttons while they - uh - govern."
2098,Magazine,A chilling picture of a man so empty it takes tens of thousands to fill his void.
2099,Magazine,I am surprised that Trump never got into the car/used car sales business. Maybe Mr. Huber feels the same way.
2100,Magazine,"The next thing, he'll hire a documentarian to do a Triumph of the Will redux. He'll fly his plane over a stadium on Alabama, just as he did during the campaign. Then he'll tell his supporters to beat some one up, just as he did in 2016. It's the show folks. A perfect example was last week when he threw away the prepared remarks, said this is boring, and proceeded to bash Mexicans."
2101,Magazine,"Loyalty rally and Ego Fix.  Just like a long time Junkie or Alcoholic, HE must get his drug of choice.  The adoration from the Crowd, the chance for complete attention, the opportunity to SHOW the magnificence that is Trump.

Didn't like Obama?  Fine, that's your right. (And while you toss out criticism about our 44th president here, there, and everywhere, keep in mind that Obama was hardly the first modern president to use a TelePrompter and speechwriters.)

2110,Upshot,"There have certainly been enough men caring for children in the last decade to include them in this article. The results for men who stay home to care for children or the elderly are similar. What the NYT needs are more articles pressing for changes in how HR handles anyone with a gap in their career. The low labor-force participation rate for men indicates that many men never return to the workforce after a period of unemployment.<br/><br/>Too many people, female and male, end up in the zone where they have too much experience to get hired for a near entry-level position, yet their experience is too stale to get hired in a more experienced capacity."

If you do that in your prime career building years, of course it will reduce your earnings significantly.  I don't see this as a problem in itself.  Lots of life choices are supobtimal for one's career, but there's so much more to life than money.  Having a child is a choice among others that will cost you earnings, such as majoring in English instead of Engineering, or working on environmental advocacy instead of at Goldman Sachs, but it's a joyous choice that is worth more than anything money can buy.  Focusing on fulfillment in life, instead of sacrificing everything for your career, does cost you earnings; nobody ever claimed otherwise."
2115,Upshot,"This is interesting to me, because it supports the anecdotal advice I've been giving to younger female professionals.  Work your butt off in your 20s, I tell them, so that when you're in your 30s and having kids you have the income to pay for help and the professional clout to demand flexibility.  Kids are awesome, but the biological timing of them for women is a real challenge, and I wish more professionals would openly discuss this.  "

As if that choice were unilateral.  <br/><br/>Why not the same level of vitriol for the male employees who also presumably chose to have children?  Using the same logic, shouldnât they also bear the same adverse consequences on their careers?  <br/><br/>So why arenât they?  <br/><br/>Because women are still viewed as the primary caregivers, whether or not they work full time.  Not until employment laws, and employers, treat men and women equally in that respect will anything change.

That stereotype is played out in reality as well. According to Pew, men and women tend to spend about the same number of hours per week doing some combination of child care, housework, and paid work. However, men on average worked 43 hours a week, but spent a mere 7 hours with their kid. An hour a day with one's kid (assuming most parents would rather spend time with their child than go to work), seems like very little work/life balance to me. For reference, women work an average of 25 hours/week and care for children 15 hours/week.<br/><a href=""http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/06/15/fathers-day-facts/"" title=""http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/06/15/fathers-day-facts/"" target=""_blank"">http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/06/15/fathers-day-facts/</a>"

Teenagers who commit crimes, such as vandalism, are still impressionable and often times only need to be guided in the right direction. Some authors in the article pose doubts about how using reading as a punishment could backfire. However, I think they have it backwards. Judge Avelina Jacob did not punish the teenagers, instead she gave them a new outlook, a different perspective. Isnât that what all books provide anyways? <br/><br/>Perspective. <br/><br/>Perspective helped one of the teenagers understand the significance of the swastika and come out of the shadows of ignorance. Sentencing teenagers to community service will NOT help them understand why their actions were faulted. <br/><br/>Authors often times use words to reflect the underlying issues in society or history. Reading is not limited to teenagers who commit vandalism crimes, it is an opportunity for everyone to gain a new perspective and to apply that perspective to their own life."

He was scared of Ben Brantley, I was speechless and I have never read these reviews the same way since. There are people who pour years of love and every ounce of their creative energy into a work and it can be destroyed in one review.

2174,Insider,"I attended Antioch for a year ( I was indeed one of those ""passing through"" students, but made many lifelong friends. Rural Ohio was just a bit much for me at the time). This was a policy that was agreed upon collectively, crafted by the community, for the community, and students subsequently enrolled in the school enthusiastically supporting this policy. If someone didn't want to adhere to the Sexual Offense Prevention Policy, they didn't have to come on campus, and they would not be welcome on campus. These brave students who created the SOPP wanted to carve out one tiny speck of place where entitled sexual behavior would have limits. I don't think for a minute that Antioch students believed this policy would be a magic bubble following them throughout their lives. But it was a refuge. And a guiding light. All commentators wringing their hands about how no one would ever have sex or flirt if they had to ask permission could use a re-education on healthy sexuality and consent."

This fits with the history of progressivism as never once being unsustainable in the management of government, either economically or socially.

2176,Insider,"I came of age in the 70s and went off to college in the early 80s, so pre-Antioch handbook. At my super-progressive school the hot debate in the admin. was whether it was OK that professors should ever have sex with their students or whether this was always sexual harassment due to the imbalance of power. The professors had mixed opinions, as did the students. <br/><br/>It was my mother who had earlier ""codified"" sexual conduct for me, during an intensely uncomfortable discussion we had when I was 14. She introduced two very strong concepts: that the woman must enjoy herself at all stages, or it's no good; and that the woman's use of the word ""no"" at any time must bring the whole thing to a complete halt. My mother told me about how her father had taught her to squeeze a man's testicles has hard as she could if she should ever be introduced to them without first giving her consent. She told me to think of the word ""no"" as a warning hand around my testicles. (My grandfather's? Hers?!? Yes, it was a really uncomfortable talk we had).<br/><br/>Nonetheless, these seemed like perfectly reasonable guidelines for me to follow in life, and follow them I did. The Antioch guidelines enhance that with language about determining positive consent at each stage of the encounter. "

The SOPP is a body positive affirmative policy that makes clear that ALL persons have every right to want what they want.<br/><br/>If you took someone's car and drove it around without consent you could not get away with it by saying ""well they never said no"", the SOPP basically says that human beings have the same rights. That's it. <br/><br/>As for me personally the SOPP has been so positive and wonderful in my life.  since 1998 when I started, I have explained and worked within the yes means yes rules of the SOPP.  I have been happy married for 10 years this fall, and yes I do still ask my spouse ""is it ok if I..."" and yes it is really sexy and yes it works.  "
2179,Insider,"I don't understand why we don't hear about sexually predator lesbians. Aren't there any?  <br/><br/>We hear about female teachers having affairs with minor students, mostly male students, but we don't hear much about female adults who are sexual predators at work.  There are a few lawsuits about men who claimed retaliation at work after the end of a mutual sexual relationship but that's about it. "
2180,Insider,"Non verbal communication actually happens..as someone who's had many sexual encounters where wordless consent happened the absurdist reductionist attitude of Atioch's consent policy, yes, in the real world, is nothing less than ridiculous.   If the rest of the academic world has 'caught up' (guffaw!) to ANtioch it was for the necessity of legally indemnifying itself from the myriad of civil suits lodged against them by victims of sexual assault.  Antioch's policy was the brain child of a group of teenagers and zealots, and remains a joke.  Yes, no means no, it always has.  The idea that the overwhelming majority of guys need to be reminded of this is a myth.  I heard 'no' often, and had no problem with it.  When a man refuses to acknowledgeg a women's 'no' call the police, don't subjugate every single male to an absurd monlithic standard."
2181,Insider,"I don't really believe this is a big issue. Men aren't interested, as internet women are far less trouble, disease free, and not a financial threat. Women have a wide variety of toys available. They also do not want children in college or soon after. Is this really an issue anywhere, anymore?"
2182,Insider,"This all sounds lovely. But if early humans had been required to constantly talk to each other, deciding on a minute-to-minute basis whether they were going to mate or not, we would probably not have survived as a species. Not that there's anything wrong with that. "
2183,Insider,"Here is a very simple process for heterosexual courtship. The man, because he is expected to, pushes the limits of intimacy in a gradual, step-by-step way. At any point, the woman may say ""No"" and if she does, he must stop. Qui tacet consentire videtur. There is nothing wrong with this. Most women want this."
2184,Insider,"This 60-year-old man is bemused and saddened that the idea of actually having to ask - or stop - brings out phrases in the comments below like ""sex police""  and ""external morality"".  The only ""external"" I am seeing here is that the person who is initiating sex is having to deal with the possibility that there is another person in the room.  I've never understood how that part could be considered optional.  "
2185,Insider,"I graduated from Kent State way back in the '60s and recall a wild weekend spent at Antioch attending meetings and seminars on Castro and the Cuban revolution. It was my first exposure to what a wonderful atmosphere of freedom and democracy Antioch practiced. It treated students as adults. My son graduated from Antioch, and, when I attended his graduation, I was pleased to see that it was still at the forefront of social action. A wonderful, unique school."
2186,Insider,"I am a man who graduated from Antioch (attending from 1992 to 1996). In my file cabinet, I found a copy of the â94-â95 âAntioch College Survival Handbook,â which detailed âThe Antioch College Sexual Offense Policyâ (as it was known back then).<br/><br/>For the curious, here are excerpts under the âConsentâ section:<br/><br/>-If sexual contact and/or conduct is not mutually and simultaneously initiated, then the person who initiates sexual contact/conduct is responsible for getting the verbal consent of the other individual(s) involved.<br/>-Obtaining consent is an on-going process in any sexual interaction. Verbal consent should be obtained with each new level of physical and/or sexual contact/conduct in any given interaction, regardless of who initiates it. Asking âDo you want to have sex with me?â is not enough. The request for consent must be specific to each act.<br/>-The person with whom sexual contact/conduct is initiated is responsible to express verbally and/or physically her/his willingness or lack of willingness when reasonably possible.<br/>-If someone has initially consented but then stops consenting during a sexual interaction, she/he should communicate withdrawal verbally and/or through physical resistance. The other individual(s) must stop immediately.<br/>-To knowingly take advantage of someone who is under the influence of alcohol, drugs and/or prescribed medication is not acceptable behavior in the Antioch community.<br/><br/>To me, the Sexual Offense Policy has always been about mutual respect."
2187,Insider,"The Sex is like cooking skit is performed by a theater group called B.R.I.D.G.E.S<br/><br/>Building relations in dialogue, growing with every step.<br/>The members on stage in this video are the second iteration of BRIDGES, summer 98- handed off from the founders of that group - one of whom was Caitlin Billings. It was designed to talk about consent. The end iteration was a co-op at Antioch college. The group wrote several pieces they performed. They traveled to schools and colleges performing. They also helped with SOPP orientations.<br/>The people on stage performing (and possibly wrote Sex is like cooking, I can't remember - they inherited some pieces but wrote the rest) were in order left to right in the first still: Athena Fannin (pyrex cup), James Woten (spatula), Caitlyn Sticco (pan), Jesse Bacon and James Owen Limbach (pot)<br/><br/>Its an interesting piece of the SOPP history that seems to have been lost: part of how the next phase in how the SOPP was integrated and educated into the antioch community. There was so much positivity about it, and so much enthusiasm and embrace. But there was also struggle in the background to get it right. The mocking didn't help. So sometimes we fell down and fell down big, especially because alcohol was prevalent in the college and wider culture and mixed signals were received between greater rape culture we all came from and the transformation we were all trying to effect."
2188,Insider,Why donât women have to ask men for their verbal consent?
2189,Insider,"While the consent part of it was fine, the ""verbally asking and verbally giving"" part was way over the top.<br/>If it wasn't, it would be a standard at all colleges and universities.<br/>And not once did this article mention the greatest factor in non-consensual sexual activity in college: alcohol."
2190,Insider,"Digging back for the history of ""new movements"" is a great idea.  So.  Antioch took this direction in 1990?  And took a lot of crap for it?<br/><br/>Just 160 miles away, I was a junior at Oberlin College â in 1969.   I lived in German House- one of several on campus newly designated as ""co-ed"", a years long student campaign for ""reason"".  That was a shocking innovation at the time, accompanied by all the public uproar Antioch's was - we got into Life Magazine!  My dorm!  Zowie.  And ""the public"" was up in arms- not because of restraints on sexuality- but because we had, other end of pendulum, discarded some restraints on sexuality.  Endless editorials on the acceleration of the handbasket, worldwide; jokes.<br/><br/>I doubt anyone had ""more"" sex in our co-ed dorm (separate bathrooms, separate floors) though surely some sex now happened without constant fear of police of one kind or another.  <br/><br/>The striving - primarily by students - for improved rationality regarding human sexuality - has been going on for a long, long, time.  It took Oberlin 135 years to move from ""Ok, let's allow women to actually get a degree!"" (first to do that in the US); to ""What the heck; if they're on separate floors, what could go wrong?""... And we were not first.<br/><br/>At every point- the ""public reaction"" has been the same; ""this is the end of the world!""<br/><br/>Congratulations to the students of Antioch who fought their fight.  Be fully prepared to back your kids when they fight theirs.  The end is not in sight. "
2191,Insider,"For the alleged adults posting ridiculous ideas about how this can't work. I seriously question whether or not some of these folks aren't actually serial sexual abusers.<br/>1. You are together and about to kiss someone. All the silent parts of courting are over now. You ask to kiss them. ""May I kiss you?""<br/>2. You have kissed and you are interested in going further. You take the time during a pause in the kissing  to ask the person if they want to have sex.<br/>There are many kinds of yes, no, maybe, I'm not sure, no but we can do this... answers that could happen here. There are many ways that pause can occur from coming up for air to stopping a wandering hand. The response dictates how things go forward and it will be similar and different for everyone. As a general rule ""maybe"" and ""I'm not sure"" means No because the person has not decided and is confused. You should stop all physical stimulation at that point.<br/>If you are not mature enough to deal with this and the details of each situation in context, you should not be having sex with anyone but yourself. You probably shouldn't even be kissing people. "
2192,Insider,"There are 2 parts to the human person - there is the intellectual part and there is the animal part. Your head can say one thing, the body another. The notion of ""affirmative consent"" is a huge misunderstanding of the difference between physical and mental spaces. "
2193,Insider,"I graduated from Antioch in 1971. The school was often mischaracterized as only being a haven for sex, drugs, and rock and roll. Yes, we had plenty of all three, but we also had a deep desire to make our voices heard. We were politically and socially aware. We worked hard to effect positive change. Even though I was in Yellow Springs a quarter of a century before the SOPP evolved, most of my fellow students behaved in a manner consistent with those yet-to-be-enunciated principles.  When SNL lampooned the policy and newspapers teased out titillating articles, I beamed with pride that the Antioch community had once more tackled a serious problem. We Antiochians are proud to follow Horace Mannâs advice: âBe ashamed to die until you have won some victory for humanity.â "
2194,Insider,"I was a high school freshman in Yellow Springs when Antioch initiated their affirmative consent policy. I remember discussing the policy with my classmates (many of whom had parents who worked/taught at Antioch) and we didnât quite know what to make of it all. We were floored at the intense media presence in our little town, and did buy into some of the dismissive attitudes towards the Antioch students, though for different reasons than the media (we regarded Antioch students as eccentric black sheep of rich east coast families who spent four years in Yellow Springs living the counter-culture, then dropped the whole thing and turned corporate lawyer when it was time to inherit â surely this was more of their dilettante radicalism). But it got 14 years olds, most of us who were just beginning to explore our own sexuality, discussing consent and thinking about how to express what we wanted out of our sexual experiences. I canât speak for my classmates, but thinking about these issues empowered me to feel that it was ok to tell a partner when I wasnât comfortable, and to expect that if I said no, nothing further would occur. It also encouraged me to practice how to incorporate affirmative consent into sex in a way that was natural and fun. The architects of Antiochâs policy couldnât have known, but they provided language to express ideas this townie girl didnât even know she didnât know. "
2195,Insider,"I'm still not clear on the policy.  Does a man have to ask for consent each step of the way?  Can a man simply ask ""Is it OK with you if we go all way?""  Or ""Would it be OK to agree that when we get to a certain point, you can call time out and think about whether you want to go further?""  "
2196,Insider,"I don't think that anyone would argue that any human interaction, sexual or not, needs to involve consent.  Our legal system understands this, but also that consent is commonly provided in a number of different ways, one of which is de facto consent, where the parties know what is being asked of them and they proceed without any stated reservation.  The ridicule which Antioch College received in the 90's wasn't due to the requirement of consent in sexual relations, but in the denial that most very pleasant sexual interactions typically incorporate de facto consent.  <br/><br/>The concept that ""no means no,"" stems from the normal incorporation of de facto consent, where all one needs to show that whatever act is not wanted is to simply say so, indicating that consent is not given.<br/><br/>The video failed to address how something as simple, and natural, as ""no means no"" was not adopted at Antioch College, and how that led to the public ridicule which the college's policy received."
2197,Insider,"True story. A long time ago, in a car after a high-school date, I asked the girl if she knew what a French Kiss was and would she like to try. ""Oh no,"" she replied. ""It makes me want to do things I don't want to do."" Completely misunderstanding her reply, I never gave her that kiss. At the time, the universal ""No"" had various ""grades"" you had to understand and which I mostly missed. Speaking openly and clearly about sex is positive for everyone. "
2198,Insider,This kind of communication would have made my younger and even middle aged life so much simpler.   
2199,Insider,"If the students cannot handle sex without being told that using words to get consent during sex is possible, how will they face the real world where the sex police don't hand out consent forms that speak ""Antioch""?"
2200,Insider,"The me too movement is just the latest iteration of the campus feminists' efforts to practice rape politics to their advantage without having to bother with the ugly  and often politically troubling realities of real rape.  Starting in the 1990s, these activists demanded vast expansion of rape law.  They did not listen to those of us on the front lines of fighting for more rape prosecutions in real courts, where we were slowly making the system more responsive to real victims including children and men.  They did not care, then or now, that their activism, mixed with leftist politics and often anti-law enforcement attitudes, would discredit sober and serious anti-rape activism and make it harder to get real rapists put away.  They wanted their politics and their interpretations and their scapegoats  and special privileges rather than learning to work with and within the real justice system.  They are driven by entitlement, not any commitment to justice for all.  They are incapable of shame."
2201,Insider,"My college had an affirmative consent policy that applied at every stage of the sexual encounter, but it allowed both verbal and nonverbal consent. So really, the only time you needed to get *verbal* consent is when the nonverbal signs were ambiguous. It's shocking to me that this kind of policy is so controversial. What kind of person, when they're unsure if their partner is enjoying the sexual counter, forges ahead anyway? Asking if the other person is okay is the natural reaction. And honestly, forging ahead without checking in on an apathetic partner says horrible things about the quality of campus sex happening, consensual or not. (Shouldn't your partner seem like they're *enjoying* the sex?) Antioch's policy of mandatory verbal consent strikes me as a bit unrefined--but so what? It was the first! Modern affirmative consent policies just make sense and we owe Antioch a debt of gratitude for helping to develop them."
2202,Insider,"If _both_ members of a couple (which may not be male/female) do not _in fact_ have a ""veto""--the ability to consent, or not--that would be assault, right? This principle is not limited to Yellow Springs.<br/><br/>Oh, and even an affirmative-consent approach does not require ""stopping,"" if the (mutual) consent is ongoing and enthusiastic. If you know what I mean."
2203,Insider,When I was working in Counseling  in 1988 I attended a lecture on sexuality at the University of Florida  in Gainesville . Remember its 1988!<br/>The male  lecturer asked the men in the audience to raise their hands if they ever had sex when their partner said NO at anytime during or before the act.<br/>There were probably 150 male students in the hall and over half the men raised their hands with puzzled expressions on their faces.<br/>The lecturer then told them they had committed Rape yes that this was rape . The guys were stunned. They had naively raised their hands because they didn't think they had done anything wrong!<br/>Its wonderful that Antioch took this further but the thoughts about this issue have been discussed on campuses for a long time . 
2204,Insider,"Itâs always interesting to watch people twist themselves into a pretzel over this issue, wanting to simultaneously have sex as an unrestricted free-for-all because any kind of sex âis normal and naturalâ, while also trying to apply an external morality about consent.  You canât really have it both ways."
2205,Insider,"""Itâs time to go back to single-sex dorms and courtship since women clearly cannot handle these situations themselves""<br/><br/>Men, on the other hand, are doing a really stellar job !"
2206,Insider,These sort of policies smack of a big brother police state writ small. Truly regressive. Administrators peering into a bedroom to âprotect youâ. Just crazy. 
2207,Insider,"I went to college in Ohio in 1971. A roommate and I would hitch hike to Yellow Springs on weekends to hike in the woods there, and to get a little taste of what Antioch College was all about. I didn't really understand what was going on there, but I loved the edginess of the Antioch campus. The students were different, and confident in their difference. The place was had its finger on the pulse of the culture, and reflected it. They were open to changes in sexual norms happening at that time - they had co-ed dorms, and even a co-ed shower. I am not surprised #metoo happened here 25 years ahead of the rest of America. Even now, I feel like I have something to learn about believing in myself and speaking up from the Antioch students. Thanks for this video. "
2208,Insider,"The video portrays uniform ridicule in the media, but I was a columnist at the Daily Camera in Boulder, Colorado at the time and published a column in support of the Antioch rules. <br/><br/>I remember quoting from Molly Bloom's long, often erotic soliloquy at the end of Joyce's ""Ulysses"" in support of my position:<br/><br/>"" . . . and then I asked him with my eyes to ask again yes and then he asked me would I yes to say yes my mountain flower and first I put my arms around him yes and drew him down to me so he could feel my breasts all perfume yes and his heart was going like mad and yes I said yes I will Yes.""<br/><br/>I understand what an easy target the policy was for comedians and media skeptics. But it was all a matter of how you looked at it. Consent is sexy, and communication is the essence of great sex. Yes?"
2209,Insider,Itâs time to go back to single-sex dorms and courtship since women clearly cannot handle these situations themselves.
2210,Insider,"I'm an Antioch alum -- a graduate, to clarify and differentiate between those who stopped in for a year or two -- from right before the SOPP was written. I know several of the core authors; they're lifelong friends.<br/><br/>What this article gets closer to than any before it is a misconception that Antioch was sex-negative. It wasn't; just the opposite. But some misinterpreted anything goes as anything is welcome. To fix this many of us used an informal policy: ask. <br/><br/>I'll answer a question I think it implicit in the countless articles and commentaries I've seen. As a heterosexual man, an alum, from this era, we still had lots of consensual, fun sex. Men weren't put down. We weren't hated. We weren't berated. We weren't demeaned. We knew that whomever we were sleeping with wanted to be there. Some elements weren't so clear back then: lots of these encounters happened when one or both of us (usually both) were probably too intoxicated to give consent but, for the most part, we usually got it right.<br/><br/>Why then the SOPP? Because a small number of people ignored, misused, and abused this informal policy. Was the SOPP perfect? No - it was written, in haste, by a group of teens and 20-something's. But, as a first of it's kind, it's OK. <br/><br/>My only regret about the SOPP is it tends to block the sun. Antioch shines in the classroom - it's a very good school - but the SOPP has put too much focus on the dorm-room."
2211,Insider,I reference Antioch's sex policy in my memoir Acanemia. The policy was indeed ahead of its time.<br/><br/>LH
2212,Insider,"Much coverage of this policy -- its origin, intent, purpose, requirements, etc.<br/><br/>But almost nothing on how it actually played out in real life. Only on its effectiveness in curbing reports of abusive practice."
2213,Insider,Antioch rocks!   And rolls.  ;)
2214,Insider,"This article raises a plethora of questions that beg to be asked and answered. How does signing a policy change anything? What does ""not tolerable' mean? Is it legally enforceable? Is intoxication a defense to violating the policy? Who decides? Is there any evidence that consent became ""part of the culture"" once the orientation session ended?<br/>Is Bethany Saltman saying that the policy was actually written to help women say yes, rather than allow them to say no? If so, what does this have to do with #metoo issues? if a woman who signs the policy statement says she was raped on campus, does that relieve Antioch from liability?<br/>How does this square with this weekend's opinion piece by Maureen Dowd which makes the case that young women are hooking up regularly, quite intentionally, disproving Saltman's statement that, ""It can be really hard to say yes?""  "
2215,Insider,"May I touch your hand?<br/>May I hold your hand?<br/>May I squeeze your hand?<br/>May I stroke your hand?<br/>May I stroke your cheek?<br/>May I kiss you on the cheek?<br/>May I kiss your neck?<br/>May I put my arm around your waist?<br/>May I kiss you on your lips?<br/>...<br/>It's a family newspaper, so we'll stop there.<br/>But it's ridiculous.  People aren't like that.  "
2216,Insider,"Long before the 1990's consent form at Antioch, students there were talking about this issue. <br/><br/>I was a student there in 1975 and 1976 when a number of women students reported being sexually pressured by the same professor. I was one of those students. At the time, nothing was done by the administration and we all decided to boycott or drop out of that professor's classes. At the same time, the larger issue of sexual consent amongst students themselves was raised. Again, nothing formal was done, but our discussions contributed to the serious dialogue that was always encouraged at Antioch. The explicit consent form from the 1990's probably grew out of those discussions in the 1970's. <br/><br/>Antioch was never perfect but it is still ahead of other colleges in so many ways. Antioch respects students' opinions and their diverse voices.... It was the only college I applied to. I knew it was where I belonged..."
2217,Insider,"Wrong. No arrests would be made, unless you called the police, and by hypothesis you're unwilling to object. Why would you not object?"
2218,Insider,"The car example is, in any case, a false analogy.<br/><br/>I'm not defending the thuggish behavior of a Trump or a Weinstein: touching someone with absolutely no cue of invitation, for example. That would be like just hopping into someone's car and starting to drive it away, without permission.<br/><br/>I am saying that most people, including most women, prefer the traditional courtship rituals that depend on non-verbal cues, the art of flirting and the simple principle that ""No means no.""<br/><br/>A better analogy would be that the Antioch rules are like saying that, if you visit my place, you have to ask ""May I sit in this chair?"" and ""May I put my handbag on the floor here?"" and ""May I touch this book on the coffee table?"" and so on.<br/><br/>A few questions like that are polite, but one is not a good houseguest if one keeps asking for permission at every turn. Most people feel the same way about what makes a good lover. And there is nothing wrong with that."
2219,Insider,first) what's worse - minor annoyance from a partner from being asked if they want to have sex or not asking and assaulting someone? 
2220,Insider,"Actually, I have submitted comments critical of the Antioch rules and they have been posted.<br/><br/>I think it is important for more men to speak out, as you have done, about the way so many women discourage asking first."
2221,Insider,"Do you have experience with this, or just curiosity?  It isn't heard of much, which leads me to believe it isn't happening much. With the level of disdain for anyone but heterosexuals still high, you would think the goose had laid a golden egg with a story of that nature. I suppose you could do a google search. "
2222,Insider,"If this is not about female purity/virtue/innocence, why is it that women, who in traditional sexist societies are condemned  for any sexual experience at all, are the ones so horrified they will receive an unwanted touch?  Men, whose purity few care about, are never worried that a woman might try to kiss them without permission.  "
2223,Insider,"I'm sure you think you're being pro-woman here, but you fail to grasp the point of consent and these rules. The point is that it DOES have an impact, it IS harmful, even the smallest things, or what YOU would consider small. Being fondled or kissed by someone you don't want to touch you makes you feel violated, even if you personally can't relate to that. Someone ""accidentally"" brushes too close to you on the bus; a new acquaintance rests his hand on your lower back; a guy you work with always squeezes you so hard when you hug that he crushes your chest against his--all of these things hurt in ways that cannot be seen in the moment.  And when that is the landscape of one's world, when we constantly have to be on guard in ways that men cannot relate to, it teaches us to stay away from the spotlight, to be a smaller presence, to try to protect ourselves from so many men around us, to keep quiet when we want to scream and say, ""Get your hands off of me."" I don't need to wait until something happens to tell a man to stop, I want rules in place where he knows that if he touches me without my permission, there will be consequences. <br/><br/>This isn't about virginal purity or innocence; it's about human rights. If you can't see that yet, if you're not listening to what so many millions and millions of women have been saying, then you are doing so not out of accidental ignorance, but out of a choice not to listen. "
2224,Insider,"Eve: I think our difference is this: you, like most people in our society, think these actions are offensive by their very nature.  I think almost all of the offensiveness is ingrained in us by our culture.  Our culture doesn't teach men to be bothered by some minor sexual advance by a woman.  It does teach men to be offended by advances by other men because our culture is homophobic.  I feel that in many subtle ways, our culture promotes the attitude that women will not be respected if they are thought to be too sexually available.  This is a holdover from more puritanical days past.  As a result, when women experience some violation of sexual taboos, they feel a psychological distress that goes far beyond any physical harm done to them.  This harm would not occur if women were not indoctrinated into the idea that these relatively trivial occurrences were serious assaults on their self worth.  I would like to see the culture change.  Making a big deal about small offenses moves us in the wrong direction."
2225,Insider,"See the detailed comment from  Giridhar Kamath who said about who is required to ask for consent:<br/><br/>-If sexual contact and/or conduct is not mutually and simultaneously initiated, then the person who initiates sexual contact/conduct is responsible for getting the verbal consent of the other individual(s) involved.<br/><br/>It's not just men; it is required of women also.  "
2226,Insider,"You might want to see the car analogy later in the comments. (It's slightly less scary than the mugging anlogy, or the rape analogy.)"
2227,Insider,"Great suggestions. Here's another couple: ""I'd like to go all the way but my rule when thinking about having sex is to discuss birth control first and make sure we're both tested for STDs."" And, ""I never have sex with a woman when we've both been drinking, lest she thinks I'm easy."""
2228,Insider,"In Reply to Mark Swanholm:<br/><br/>You write that you found that a lot of people did not ""feel able to tap out once they got started."" Instead of the Antioch rule of affirmative consent, there is a much simpler solution: Those people should overcome these feelings, develop a greater sense of responsibility and realize that in fact they are able to tap out."
2229,Insider,"No one is saying it is undesirable to talk during sex. The objection to the Antioch rule is that it incorrectly defines ""consent"" as a particularly explicit *expression* of consent, and thus tells people that they *must* talk during sex in certain mandated ways."
2230,Insider,"I didn't go to Antioch but I remember this story. Our society really needs to get a sense of humor. If sex is really to be this serious, scholarly, clinical topic then no one is ever going to have any fun again. Sex is supposed to be joyful and fun. Everyone needs to lighten up a little! I am not suggesting that rape is ok or that men don't need some kind of training in appropriate behavior but if we're not careful, the sexes will be more polarized than ever and distrustful of each other."
2231,Insider,"In Reply to atb:<br/><br/>I completely agree with you. Of course rape and other forms of sexual assault are not OK. Men (and women) need to stop when they hear ""No,"" and women (and men) need to mean it when they say it. <br/><br/>But the Antioch rule of affirmative consent is an example of what Camille Paglia meant two decades ago when she wrote that ""[t]he fanatic overprotection of women is fast making us an infantile nation.""<br/><br/>It's too late. The sexes already are more polarized and distrustful than ever, and we have become that infantile nation she warned of. "
2232,Insider,"So,  you don't think it would be ""awkward and unecessary"" for the ""nonconsenting party"", who didn't even ask to be in this situation, to say no?"
2233,Insider,"In reply to Frankster:<br/><br/>The fault was not yours. It was hers. I had a similar experience making out with a woman after a party. She said ""Oh, stop."" So I stopped. Then she gave me a surprised, slightly scornful look and said ""You don't think I meant it, did you?!""<br/><br/>Women (or men, for that matter, either gay or straight) can not rely on ""No means no"" if people send the kind of false signals you and I, and probably most men, have experienced. It often puts men in the difficult, and sometimes impossible, position of having to become ""mind readers.""<br/><br/>Perhaps the Antioch rule of affirmative consent was put in place as a solution to this problem. But there was, and is, a better solution. People should never send false signals like this."
2234,Insider,"I am not responsible for what you think. <br/><br/>Think about how what you say to me artificially transforms me into some thing that suits your point which is exactly what you are accusing me of doing.  <br/><br/>The issue is one where youth and inexperience is the controlling factor as are human frailties and levels of development and sophistication. Adults with experience don't have the same sexual problems as children new to sex and High School or in college do.<br/>Good for you about the boundaries, not everyone is so lucky as to be able to relate to others so effectively in calm situation let alone ones where they are feeling physical sensations that conflict with what they are thinking and both the physical and mental sensations might be conflicting with the emotional aspects of what is going on. That is a lot for middle aged people let alone kids and young adults. "
2235,Insider,"I am sorry that you have had the experience of having a man ignore you when you said ""No!"" That is not what I have been arguing for. That is not the behavior of someone trying to be a good man."
2236,Insider,"Thanks.  This policy has certain classist implications.  Students from households with a high level of education may feel perfectly adept, confident in verbalizing intimate matters.  But in much of America, that's not so. In the family, working class parents are often unaccustomed to this and can think it's wrong.  In the public space, you never know if the listener belongs to a value system that discourages frankness.  And in private, people often simply prefer to communicate non-verbally.  <br/><br/>Sometimes this communication can be most eloquent!  I recall one afternoon when I was haltingly attempting to attain the kind of assent the people at Antioch envision, to the exasperation of the woman I was with.  ""You're talking too much!  Why not just let it be, and unfold naturally?"""
2237,Insider,"These are young people who are just entering their sexual lives, they don't need to be thrust into the sexual ""real world""--whatever that is. They are spending 4 years at an educational institution where using words is part of the culture and the norm will mean that they will be ready to take on the ""real"" world with confidence and plenty of practice in using their voice and will hopefully expect others to use theirs. That is how the world changes. "
2238,Insider,"Maybe they'll all turn down men who think ""sex police"" are the ones who decides whether a woman says ""yes""."
2239,Insider,"My favorite poet.  I'd let that one slip from active recall.  Brilliant, as poets are, in pointing out the conflicts we share.  <br/><br/>At multiple places, she says the equivalent of ""stop"" - ""what's too far said he, where you are said she""  - that's clear, yes?  And yet.<br/><br/>We all of us know; male and female, that if he'd stopped there as requested- the rest of the poem, including her plainly stated delight at the outcome - would not ever have happened.<br/><br/>This is an ancient part of human sexuality - and one we still discuss either not at all, or very badly - and it needs to be put on the table.  Thank you, e.e. , and Rick."
2240,Insider,"""What kind of person, when they're unsure if their partner is enjoying the sexual counter, forges ahead anyway?""  Are you under the impression that's a sensible question?  There are an abundance of answers-  the frat boy engaged in a sexual conquest contest?  (Under way NOW, I guarantee, on many, many campuses)  The guy who's too drunk to think?  The scumbag who thinks the girl is too drunk to remember?  How old are you? ..."
2241,Insider,"Geez, you get the daily award for nonsensical statement! Antioch College never had much of an endowment to use as a cushion when things were tight. The big donations go to Harvard, Stanford, Yale, etc., schools that actually are doing well. Small liberal arts colleges are struggling today, probably more than when Antioch closed the college. But Antioch resurrected itself. How many colleges have you heard of that had such involved alumni and supporters that they succeeded in returning from the dead? To refer to the efforts to reduce sexual violence that results from assumptions made by one person about another as ""militancy"" surely demonstrates that you don't really understand the word. "
2242,Insider,"David this isnât what closed Antioch,  Antioch had other issues - demographic changes, affordability changes, an alumni base that was not as affluent as some others, poor choices in investments and many other factors.  To be sure the Antioch Board of Trustees at the time of the policy were opposed, as were some alumni.  But this was classic Antioch since 1852 - and as others have noted decidedly ahead of its time.  Yes we were militant but making change requires the courage to stand up in the face of ridicule or even violence and say ENOUGH - there has to be a better way. The kids at Parkland understand as did my friends at Antioch in the 90âs."
2243,Insider,It does not appear as though you have read/watched this piece and understood its content. This is *exactly* about how women *can* handle themselves in these situations. Your comment about separated dorms implies to me that you think men can't (or shouldn't) control themselves in the presence of women. It takes (at least) 2...
2244,Insider,"I rather thought it was because MEN couldn't handle themselves. They don't pick up the kinds of subtle cues women use. As my husband of 25 years says - when it comes to communicating with men, don't be subtle!"
2245,Insider,"Hi Michael, thank you for representing Antioch! I agree this was for those who might abuse the policy, but it was also for those who wouldn't intentionally, but since they might not have thought about consent on this level before, may have abused it in the past without realizing it (including those who did not feel entitled to set limits or know their own limits). It was about getting people thinking and talking about a subject most of us don't engage in publicly. AND importantly for me at the time, it was about giving the administration a due process to follow, a set of guidelines that could support their work to support students. It was about so much more, as well, but I'll leave it there!"
2246,Insider,"I'm sorry, meloop, about the challenge you describe in maintaining your sexual mojo when things get too thinky. Maybe you could see someone about that. But your claims about ""real world"" sex ring false to this grandmother, who's had plenty. Talk doesn't ruin sex. Talk builds intimacy which betters sex for women, so if you have female partners, this ought to be of interest to you. Saying that sex is ""as mindless an act as humans carry out"" suggests to me that you might serve yourself and any potential partner better if you introduced communication to your bedroom skills. Get your mind in the game! Your body, and perhaps your partner, will follow."
2247,Insider,"I would guess that you have never tried approaching sexual experience in the way discussed in this article. If you had done so, it it very likely that you would have discovered that  sex is not a mindless act and that letting your mind in on the process can enhance the experience substantially.  The driving force behind this approach to sex is certainly not to prevent it, but to make it more positive, meaningful, and valuable. "
2248,Insider,We'll start with basics for you remedial types. <br/><br/>No means NO!
2249,Insider,"Hi there. Thank you for the great questions, many of which do in fact need to be worked out, especially regarding legality. <br/><br/>#Metoo is all about sexual autonomy and entitlementâfor ALL of us to be empowered to say yes and no to whatever we fancy. <br/><br/>It may not be hard to ""hook up"" but to actually, out loud, say YES might be. "

2251,Insider,"And human culture evolves, yes. One hopes, at least. Seems there are a lot of forces about who want to stay stuck in, or return to, past ways. Mostly for power reasons."

2258,Business,"Anna - Credit cards were in common use in the U.S. long before they were in other parts of the world, but you're too young to remember that.  I traveled extensively in the 60s and early 70s and used to purchase travelers' checks to use abroad because credit cards were simply not used much in Europe or especially Africa.  As credit cards became more common in other parts of the world, we in the U.S. became victims of a phenomenon known as leap-frogging.  The new systems being introduced allowed the use of the latest technology as the time of installation.  But REPLACING an older technology with a newer technology on a widespread basis is both expensive and involves a lot of logistical problems.  It can take a long time for the problems associated with an old system to begin outweighing the benefits of the new sufficiently that the expense and disruption are considered justifiable."

2262,OpEd,"What you describe seems similar to the challenge of finding an accomplished and serious scientist who does not accept evolution. In other words, it's not that there's no room for a diversity of views amongst scholars, but rather at some point the data either render a particular claim or argument obsolete (for instance creationism or supply-side economics) or a and/or some other claim clearly becomes fact (evolution or the value of investing in social programs). Many people have been saying that U.S. colleges and universities suffer from a liberal bias. But another possibility is that becoming skilled at reasoning, and acquiring a great deal of information, brings you, inevitably, to embrace core progressive ideas. It's not that you have to be liberal to survive as a scholar, it's that knowledge makes you liberal."

2268,Politics,The GOP certainly has found a way of messaging that the Democrats just canât match.  âImpeach the Presidentâ is part of the same game where the NRA has given the green light to GOP reps in Congress to talk about possible gun control in order to sell more guns.  Why are the Dems so terrible at marketing and sales?  They need some serious help and soon.  
2269,Politics,"Impeach Trump? No way. Not in a million years. What has President Trump done that rises to an impeachable offense? Nothing, absolutely nothing! What he has done though, and quite triumphantly, is steer the nation back in the direction of becoming the nation for which the original Patriots fought and died. As each day passes, Americans are more and more convinced that they made the right choice in November 2016, electing Donald J. Trump to the Office of the President of the United States of America, its Chief Executive, its Commander in Chief. There has been no better time in history to be an American! President Trump has triumphed! And he will continue to triumph triumphantly through 2024! I support the President. I support Trump. Thank you."
2270,Politics,"""If, if, if, if, if â always ""if:""<br/><br/>""Republicans [are] unwilling to consider impeachment for impeachable offenses if they are brought to light by the Mueller investigation ...""<br/><br/>Most of us couldn't care less what ""Republicans"" are or are not willing to do IF Mueller brings some impeachable offense to light, or IF Mueller gets fired, or IF, IF, IF. Always ""if."" What bothers most Americans, though, is the endless idle chatter about Trump ALREADY being guilty of an impeachable offense. ""Ifs"" we can live with (though one does wish Mueller wouldn't treat his appointment as a lifetime job). But let's not forget that nobody -- not Mueller or anybody else -- has got beyond the ""if"" stage yet. "
2271,Politics,"Republicans have always been expert at false messaging--they know exactly how to steal their opponent's lines and twist and mutilate them to their own advantage.<br/><br/>II used to think that quietly going about doing the right thing is enough---everyone will see through all the lies and dirty dealings and come around and make good decisions!<br/><br/>But I don't know, anymore.

2273,Politics,Why do so many of the fine NYT readers attempt to argue with reason about the impeachment of Trump. What have they seen that might suggest that republican voters will be ready to succumb to reason. The threat of impeachment is a powerful strategy that democrats will need to counter effectively if they are to maximize the success of the midterms.
2274,Politics,"Even as Democrats, we're not all that happy with the way our politicians have  done almost nothing to curb Trump's damage to our country. Yes, I and millions of other Americans will vote for Democrats just to impeach Trump. He's ruined our country in less than 2 years. He needs to be gone asap."
2275,Politics,I think it will be Republicans who end up impeaching Trump. It would be much easier to get their agenda enacted with Pence ... if anyone can find Pence.

All I hear, see and read about are the marches, the overwhelming number of first time candidates throwing hats in the ring, the fund raising, the improbable wins in places like PA, AL and WI.<br/><br/>There is plenty to be galvanized over to get out and vote in November and if you are not galvanized by now then you are probably ineligible to vote because the dead cannot vote.<br/><br/>The first time Hillary or Nancy speaks the ""I"" word, the Dems chances of taking back the House fall to negative numbers."
2278,Politics,"Besides, impeachment of Trump will not do any good.  Next in line is Christian Sharia Law advocate Mike Pence.

2279,Politics,"Far too many Trump supports think that ""Impeachment"" means removal.  Trying to get 67 Senators to vote to remove Trump will be a tall order unless Robert Mueller has so much evidence that the GOP will be forced to kick him out."

Do you see greater opportunity for upward mobility?<br/><br/>This is America, home of second chances.

If he fails that, we can look at other methods...like voting him out of office."
2281,Politics,"The solution is right in front of our eyes.  It amazes me how we forget that the best solution to a conundrum, is always the simplest.<br/>VOTE. Tuesday. 6.

It is a Tuesday.  PUT IT ON YOUR CALENDAR AND HAVE YOUR COMPUTER send you daily updates for about 10 days."
2282,Politics,"Why would the threat of impeachment energize Republicans? Do people have such short memories that they don't remember Bill Clinton was impeached, and he also stayed in office? Impeachment does not mean removal from office.<br/><br/>Assuming that no Republican would vote for removal, it's extremely doubtful that there would be enough Democratic votes, even if they win some seats this year, to remove him. Trump may be impeached, but that won't get rid of him."

Democrats are angry but the response to this is not threats but focusing on change. Offering a middle of the road responsive approach will win the day.  Going to the left is not the answer as seen Rep. Lamb in Pa.<br/>The thoroughly corrupt Trump government is mind-boggling. However, the answer is getting politicians who are interested in economic equality, love of country and bipartisan compromising not further fighting."
2286,Politics,"Itâs sad to see our democracy revolving around one personâs stay in power. Itâs a hallmark of dictatorhsips to invoke a cult of personality in replacement of the countryâs best interests. Look to the elections in Egypt, China and Russia.. all of them have one common factor: âworship the leader, and save the demigodâ. Republicans are taking the countryâs politics to a new low, after theyâve successfully sowed division and self-conflict."

2288,Politics,"Democrats should dismiss it as a manufactured crisis and then move on to the real issues like health care, education, and infrastructure.   Thatâs the way to show you are more fit to govern.  "
2289,Politics,"Agreed, it is a trap.  Moreover, Democrats should realize (no matter how hard it is to look themselves in the mirror while doing so) that Trump believes in nothing, is a legendary shape-shifter and will give them much of what they want when they reclaim power.  When Dems take control of the House, Trump will become more moderate, even liberal.  He's demonstrated that he can stand up and lie about everything, without a shred of embarrassment, so when he suddenly becomes pro-choice again, or anti-gun, it won't surprise anyone, not even his base (consistency isn't what they want from him anyway).  Impeaching Trump won't get us anywhere.  Manipulating him will (ask Putin).  "
2290,Politics,"âIt separates their base from reasonable, rational people that decide elections,â said Mr. McHenry, noting that this bloc of the electorate does not âwant to put people in power that are going to create complete chaos and in essence shut down any potential legislative progress.â<br/><br/>I got this far and laughed out loud at North Carolina's Republican leadership rep in Congress. This is the blueprint for Republican behavior for many, many years, especially in the Trump era. <br/><br/>Delusional is the word that springs to mind. Maybe the whole country will be nuts by November, but I still hope Democrats of all stripes get out to vote. Fighting among ourselves is truly nuts when the future of the nation is at stake. <br/><br/>Just get rid of Trump's majority support, ideally in both houses, and build for  2020. Weaken his power and then remove him. We don't even need to do the impeachment thing. Just win some elections -- national, state and local.<br/><br/>Wake up and be smart, Democrats!"
2291,Politics,"Exactly.  Pence is the Governor who promised to keep jobs in Carrier factories; then he sold out for 7M, and allowed Carrier to move manual labor jobs to Mexico.  Carrier factories in Indiana are now run by robotics and engineers.  Maybe that is why there is an opioid crisis in middle America.  Shuttered factories, dying small towns and main streets, no money for job retraining, no money to escape to where there might be some jobs.  Clinton offered these voters hope for retraining, travel benefits, funds for sending their kids to college, health care, etc.  Of course the 26 yr. GOP hate and slander campaign had done its job.  These voters will never understand what they did to themselves.  They will never see Trump for the grifter who flew in, lied to them, and flew out.  Finally, even Trump's fake war policies won't help, because the current military is high tech and educated. "
2292,Politics,Good.  You vote to keep him.  His disapproval numbers are pretty high.  We will make it all about Trump.
2293,Politics,That's what Hillary thought.
2294,Politics,"Not talking about nuts and bolts. Just ideals, 'shoulds' or 'shouldn'ts' as it were. which are what you were addressing in your original post.

2295,Politics,"Impeachment is political not legal.  If we looked to our courts for a defense of the law rather than congress donald would be indicted rather than impeached.  He has broken plenty of laws, treason being only one. If he survives his presidential term and is not âre-electedâ he can look forward to another term anyway...a jail term.

2299,Politics,I'm a Democrat and impeachment is one of the issues that matters to me.  Never has there been a president less qualified and dangerous.  Having Trump run the country is like having Joe the plumber perform brain surgery. And there's plenty of perfectly sound legal reasons for getting rid of him besides the fact that he's a jerk.

2314,Science,"I am an adolescent and adult psychiatrist who regularly tapers patients off of antidepressants. When Prozac/fluoxetine is used during the taper off serotonergic medications, such as Cymbalta and Paxil, I have rarely seen significant withdrawal symptoms. A significant percentage of patients may find, however, that their depressive symptoms return at some point in the future.  This is not surprising given the chronic relapsing nature of the illness. "
2315,Science,"Caring for many patients with anxiety and depression, I see this played out over and over.  So many are now coming with either repeated failed attempts to stop or fear of starting in the first place.  Not every is trapped on them, but many are.  We work with them through lifestyle, diet, and natural therapies to slowly taper off at our Sanctuary Functional Medicine."
2316,Science,"There is not very thinly veiled bias in this article: Who is Dr. Allen Frances who makes this dismissive comment about the effects of antidepressants? Why does the author use the term âpill-poppingâ for the users of antidepressants? Would anybody use this term for  the use of heart medication? The real problem is that we donât know enough about the long term effects and potential damage of these drugs. That is the problem of research and the FDA. No need to make the users of antidepressants look like addicts of questionable drugs who just canât face life. Many medications have been called into question over time, their effectiveness and dangers revisited without blaming the patients. The need for help with anxiety and depression is still viewed as volontary, even frivolous. Yes, it does make you question what it says about our society, for instance that there is no compassion, no room for people who are not functioning well in this highly competitive cutthroat business world where there are not a lot of ways left to play it safe for the more sensitive crowd.

If she had had no access to mind altering drugs she might have actually become a published author by today."
2320,Science,"Evidence says SSRIs are great for ""some"" with depression, some commenters will complain: don't criticize,  it saved their lives,  some will say it ruined their lives.  <br/><br/>Evidence based medicine results in cheap,  poor care by ignoring individual differences.   A family doc with over 1000 patients might prescribes SSRIs or refers to a psychiatrist for evaluation who prescribes it in one visit to the benefit of ""some.""<br/><br/>Besides depression, it helps some with anxiety, panic attacks, insomnia and is less addictive than anxiolitics.  So docs delude themselves that it's not addictive and is the solution for those problems (like the  best solution for certain infections is a specific antibiotic.)<br/><br/>Seriously docs, we know you're not ignoring patients and throwing meds at them but it can feel that way and it doesn't take that much longer to really listen to us. "
2321,Science,"There have been very intentional effort by drug companies to avoid the term ""withdrawal"" and promote the term ""drug discontinuation syndrome"" in order not to frighten away prescribers and patients. While these drugs have their place, so do e.g., talk therapy, yoga, massage, and a saner, more humane health care system willing to underwrite such things v. cheap and abundant pills."
2322,Science,"I quit AD's cold turkey.  I have run the gamut from Prozac, Effexor and Paxil.  It took me about six months to detox.  I will never go back because they wrecked my libido and sex drive.  If I continued I would have to spend the rest of my life in a convent.  Thankfully I got my groove back after losing it for over five years."
2323,Science,"Paxil helped me get through extremely tough mental  health issues in my early 30s. It worked great for me with the added benefit of a good 15 pound weight loss. I loved that drug, but tapered myself off it slowly after a year because my emotions were too blunted and I felt I could cope without it by then. It took a good three months or more after quitting to start feeling like myself, but then I did and I've never sunk back into deep anxiety and depression. I'm so glad it was an option. "
2324,Science,"This is helpful, but there are important omissions.<br/>1) The ""research"" done by drug companies to get these drugs to market is dubious, at best. There is a heated debate among meta-analysts about whether they are, on average, effective or not, but the only real question is whether they have a very small effect, over the short-run (8 weeks, usually) and not considering side effects (which can be awful), or none at all. John Ioannidis of Stanford, one of the world's top medical research methodologists, has looked closely at this and said that the entire endeavor has been essentially corrupt and the drugs are no good and potentially very harmful. When asked if he found the situation depressing, Ioannidis said ""Yes, very; but still not depressing enough to make me ever consider taking one of these drugs.""<br/>2)The article quotes Dr. Allen Frances as correctly pointing out that apparent effectiveness is often simply placebo or passage of time (note that prior to these drugs, most cases of depression resolved within a year; with the drugs, long-term trajectories have worsened considerably). That raises serious doubts about the article's unambiguous assertion that the drugs have helped millions of people. I hate to be critical, but this is just sloppy reporting and editing.<br/>3) One of the worst fallacies in all this is that people who have withdrawal problems are often told that is an indication of their illness and that they need to take the drugs forever. Baloney."
2325,Science,"Shallow and at least somewhat irresponsible reportage.  If you struggle to ""withdraw"" (no physical dependence on SSRIs !), it's because there's still a clinical effect, most likely, and you still need the drug.  Ask almost any mental health professional!  "
2326,Science,"Its bad enough that M.D.s who are NOT specialists, ergo, G.P.s and Internists, not Psychiatrists, give this stuff out like candy without regard to the additional affects, and often without warning patients about the perils that await them if they want to go off the drug, its that they're fairly often acting like drug dealers when they prescribe this stuff without referral to at a minimum Cognitive Behavioral Therapists, let alone for Acupuncture and Herbal Medicine. Acupuncture and Herbal Medicine with Mindfulness Based Cognitive Behavioral Therapy work as well or better than Anti-depressants. <a href=""http://www.bodymindwellnesscenter.com"" title=""www.bodymindwellnesscenter.com"" target=""_blank"">www.bodymindwellnesscenter.com</a>"
2327,Science,"Reading the comments there is a lot of talk about long term serotonin deficiency, and the use of Zoloft to control it, suggesting that this drug is like insulin for diabetics. While there is likely some truth to this (the science is not settled), what I know from personal experience is that withdrawal systems are nothing like the original depression that led to my prescription."
2328,Science,"It seems to me that if we consider long-term depression to be an organic brain disease/chemical imbalance, we shouldn't be surprised if people need to remain on them long-term, just as with blood pressure meds.  So many people stop taking them when they 'feel better,' not realizing that the medication is the reason they feel better.  I would hope primary care doctors (who do much of the prescribing) and psychiatrists would be able to dig a little deeper to see if a patient's depression is situation-specific i.e. a short term crisis that requires intervention; v a life-long problem that requires life-long treatment.  Unfortunately, it's easy to just keep issuing Rxs.  Any responsible doctor will also tell you that you should 'taper' any anti-depressant, even if  it's not one of those known for withdrawal side effects.  Each person is different and has a different reaction."
2329,Science,"I take an anti-depressant for depression, fibromyalgia and sleep. I take the old tricyclic amitriptyline. My complaint is that, if they still don't know for sure how many of these medications work, they don't know what happens when it is withdrawn. I know for sure that people get many different withdrawal effects. I've seen it with other members of my family. If I want to sleep, I need my 10mg of amitriptyline. I don't know what my pain level would be without it. And because I live north of the 49th parallel, I suffer from seasonal affective disorder during the dark days of December, January and February. I didn't go on SSRIs because of the side effects. I've tried to cut down, but stopped sleeping. I'm going to keep taking this drug, because, frankly, I wouldn't stop taking my Metformin or my heart failure drugs. If there was weight gain and cardiovascular effects I'd be working harder to get off."
2330,Science,"This article is troubling in two ways.  First, it highlights the lack of health care research dollars to fund rigorous clinical studies for both pharmacological and psychotherapeutic treatments.  I would argue this is directly due to the way that we continue to talk about mental health as a culture.  Many of my patients who are on antidepressants will echo this article's shame mongering even while seeking treatment. They will be fearful of starting a medication, not want to bill their insurance for their care in an effort to hide it, or want to come off the medication immediately once symptoms are improved.  The truth is that mental illness is a chronic illness and we continue to learn more about the inflammatory connections to the progression of the disease.  Would we write the same article about diabetic drugs? Would we suggest that patients with diabetes who cannot make due without the drugs are somehow more defective than the average person?  No. The drugs would be prescribed without question to prevent the condition from getting worse. <br/><br/>However, severe depression is real (I am a mental health provider for low-income patients) and the toll it takes on lives is not highlighted nearly enough.  Let's write an article on the millions of dollars put back into the economy due to effective antidepressant treatment because someone can work; or publish an article about the quality of life someone can achieve with meds, which never can be quantified.  "
2331,Science,"Iâm a physician specializing in rationalizing (which means tapering to discontinuation in more than half of cases) psychotropic medications. As many factors are involved in this process (at least) as there are reasons a person ended up taking said medication(s).  It can be a little like playing very high stakes neurochemical Jenga. <br/><br/>With an individualized multi modal approach, many of my patients are successful in discontinuing medications within 6 months without disabling (causing one to have to stop a major part of your life, like stopping school!) side effects. Thatâs not to say there arenât any, but we work very hard to ensure we minimize frequency and duration so that these effects are tolerable.  <br/><br/>Other patients do have significant withdrawal syndromes. While this can be interpreted by many as âaddictionâ it more often is a sign of an underlying deficiency, imbalance or other seemingly unconnected medical condition. Examples of these are anemia, thyroid dysfunction, or any number of inflammatory conditions or even sleep disorders. Often enough, a dietary elimination or nutritional supplementation opens the door to curing what was previously misinterpreted as an âaddiction.â  <br/><br/>Itâs lost on many of my colleagues that there are other ways to support nervous system. But when we can involve nutritionists, acupuncturists, naturopaths, biofeedback, and other healers we are even more successful in finding better balances without (or with lower doses of fewer) meds."
2332,Science,"âThere is a cultural question here, which is how much depression should people have to live with when we have these treatments that give so many a better quality of life,â Dr. Kramer said. âI donât think thatâs a question that should be decided in advance.â<br/><br/>The reality for most older Americans is this: Their expensive health insurance severely limits the number of affordable visits they can make to see doctors or therapists yearly.  Income and accumulated wealth dictate ""quality of life"".  <br/><br/>So older people often stay on a prescription they've been able to renew with only yearly medical visits required; and continue to use a medication that they are afraid to stop taking, because they don't feel they have any other option. "
2333,Science,"I was on antidepressants for 10 years before going off them. First Prozac and then Zoloft. Yes, they keep you from being depressed. But I don't think this article does justice to the many, serious side effects of antidepressants. Yes, they're emotionally numbing and these two drugs negatively effected my libido. I was happy but had no drive  or motivation. I was content and willing to accept negative circumstances. It affected my short-term memory, harming my job performance.  It caused dry mouth, triggering dental decay.  I finally went off, slowly tapering off Zoloft. Yes, it was hard and there were many side effects, and I considered going back on. Yes, I became depressed again. I turned to transcendtal meditation to help with my depression, and it did help. I've been off antidepressants for 15 years. I greatly regret ever taking them. I feel like I lost 10 years of my life because the drugs numbed me to life and robbed me of emotions, desire, aspirations and motivation. I'll take depression over anti-depressants. Taking the drugs were like being the happy walking dead."
2334,Science,"Perhaps we need more thoughtful strategies for introducing new drugs. The FDA should require companies to include studies on withdrawal procedures for meds prescribed for pain and emotional issues such as depression and anxiety.<br/>As more and more types of drugs are created and freely offered to the unsuspecting public we need more federal control over them, including costs and side effects, not less.<br/>There is always the consideration that long term profit motives may enter into discussions by manufacturers about patients becoming dependent, which would make preliminary studies more helpful"
2335,Science,"This article has a request for folks to answer a poll question: do you  use antidepressants or not? <br/><br/>Answering that will share your private medical information with nyt, your isp, and all the advertising tracking services that set cookies and are embedded in the but webpage. Thatâs a lot of people that are going to suddenly start profiting from your medical data and sending you ads for mood drugs. "
2336,Science,"This article is dangerous and irresponsible.  Antidepressants have helped untold millions live normal lives and the dangers of discontinuation are far outweighed by the benefits of new medicines.  <br/><br/>To say, in particular, as does the former Duke professor Allen Frances, that depression improves due to the passage of time or a placebo affect is truly irresponsible.  Chemical imbalances don't cure themselves and antidepressants have provided benefits that years ago we could not have imagined.  Its views such as Dr. Frances' that perpetuate negative stereotypes regarding mental illness.  "
2337,Science,"As a former registered nurse and a background in psychiatric nursing, I wanted to share my experiences with long-term use of antidepressants and began answering the survey questions. When I reached the question requiring my first and last name and read my name would be published if my comments were selected, I changed my mind. Too bad! I think I could have contributed some worthwhile insight."
2338,Science,"Let us distinguish between people with chronic depression and anxiety (those with more than 3 episodes before age 30) vs. Those with mild or episodic depression.  As someone who falls into the former, antidepressants are required for the remainder of my life and have allowed me to function well without any more episodes. Withdrawl is not a concern for for my cohort, clearly."
2339,Science,"Reading the comments, I have a few questions.<br/>If the reason some of these meds are prescribed is to boost serotonin, is there a clinical test to determine serotonin levels?<br/>Are the physicians just running blind and going through a list of what might help?<br/>Could it be that the ones who can easily drop the SSRI meds were not previously suffering from low serotonin? If so, were they prescribed inappropriately?<br/>It's questions like this that always make me nervous about going to a doctor. Is it a lack of diagnostic rigor or  rushed visit that causes what-if prescribing, out of date training, an unexpected loyalty to a pharmaceutical company, a desire to support patient wishes?"
2340,Science,"After 10 years of opiod pain killers augmented by antidepressants prescribed to combat the insomnia brought on by the pain pills we were left with a family destroyed and a raging personality that was unrecognizable to those that knew him best.  There were no street corner deals, no meetings in parks or stairwells with street dealers. All of this, over a seventeen year period was âmedicineâ, prescribed by doctors and pain management specialists. The later always offering stronger prescriptions if the pain got to be too much. Thankfully, there were no overdoses but there was a death. Our family died.  The doctors and the pharma folks understand the addictive nature of the products they push, every bit as well as the dealer selling dime bags of smack on the corner. This is about placing profit and expedience over any moral/ethical code. This at the hand of doctors. First do no harm. But instead they enriched themselves with kick backs and gave us an epidemic that will profoundly effect families for generations and the tax payers, law enforcement etc. We can no longer trust the  medical community to police themselves or to make good medical decisions for us. They are much less than the gods they pretend to be. They are dangerous to our health and the health of the nation. BTW the same promotional campaign for pain management that worked so well in this country has now been redeployed across the developing countries so the patent holding pharmaâs can repeat the scourge."
2341,Science,I want to be sympathetic to people who suffer withdrawal symptoms but I do not if they accept a recommendation for any psychoactive drug from any physician except a psychiatrist.  They are the experts.  One would not go to a proctologist for headaches so why would one go to a gynecologist or internist for mental health issues.  I have taken antidepressants since the 1990's because of treatment resistant major depressive disorder which is in the same mental illness category as schizophrenia.  I tried every SSRI and too many other drugs to list.  I have used wellbutrin since my diagnosis and tried to stop but had a return of symptoms.  I have not had any withdrawal symptoms even going off Prestiq which is a high powered drug.  I would like to know for all the people who have experienced great difficulty what kind of doctor were they dealing with.  I have always consulted only psychiatrists for mental health issues and have not experienced any of the difficulties described in this article.  
2342,Science,"This article could have been written about my case. I was in my late 30s, raising two kids and working full time at a demanding job. I felt tired and got sick a lot. I also had mild mood swings from PMS.  I felt overwhelmed by life and my responsibilities, but I didn't feel particularly sad or depressed. During my annual exam, when I was having a particularly stressful day, my GP physician said that anti-depressants can help with fatigue and PMS, and that I should try them. <br/><br/>Worst decision ever. I started Effexor 75mg, and beyond feeling some ""blunting"" of my emotions, both happy and sad, I really didn't feel much different. I was still worn out and got sick a lot. My physician said to give it more time, and wanted to double my dose. I balked at that. Nothing really changed, so eventually I decided to go off them. I went to a half dose and felt so terrible, worse than ever before. I had brain zaps, confusion and brain fog. I was totally unable to manage my life and it didn't improve. I went back on them. <br/><br/>I've changed physicians 3 times over the years since them, and they have all said I should just stay on them, there is no harm in it, and that stopping would be worse. I guess I'm stuck. It's the only medication I take. I'm now 54 and it's been about 17 years. In retrospect, I just had too much going on in my life at that time and it was taking its toll. My problem was not in my brain. I sometimes wonder what kind of happy emotions I've missed, along with healthy sadness."
2343,Science,"The reason I have not only never taken antidepressants but manage my emotional life privately no matter what goes on in it is that almost everyone I've  known who has become a long-term user of antidepressants is changed by it in ways they can't see but which are nonetheless not as wonderful as all that.  Typically they seem more forgetful and ""scattered"" than before, more ""self-absorbed,"" and often their ability to do creative work seems to narrow or even to end completely.  (I work in the arts so most of the people I interact with do too.)  Some of them become ideologues for the antidepressant cause, proselytizing for the cause as if depression were a sanitation crisis and anyone who does not take antidepressants for it is analogous to someone throwing garbage in the streets.  I suppose a response of that kind makes sense in the context of an inability to stop taking antidepressants!  A permanent need for them must increase a longing for all the world to be in exactly the same straitjacket.  Why scorn the possibilities for management of the emotional rough ride that we refer to as ""anxiety-and-depression""--as if it were all one word, all one ""thing""--without drugs?  Because I will not subject myself to addiction for any reason, I'm concerned about the reluctance to explore non-drug approaches to remedying depression that widespread dependence on drugs brings with it culturally.   "
2344,Science,Each person is an individual who has individual needs.  Some people may respond better to different medications and may discover changes in their routines that make sense for each individual.  Its probably not wise to treat medications like a life sentence that once you use them you must use them forever.  The fact that the drug industry benefits from such a perspective is obvious and should color interpretations of patient choices.
2345,Science,"I've been taking anti-depressants for 24 years, since I found my 46 year old husband, dead in the garage.  I had always had issues with depression and anxiety, but hadn't been diagnosed or treated.  After that event, I was diagnosed with PTSD.  I have tried, twice, to quit with tapering, and with the advice of my doctor.  But, as the dose gets lower, I can feel my anger rise, and I can't seem  stop crying.  Quitting gives me the feeling of hopelessness.  I have just about given up the idea of quitting."
2346,Science,"I spent about 20 years taking antidepressants and started decreasing the amount I took about 8 years ago. 3 years ago I told my doctor I wanted to discontinue completely but she said it was better for me to stay on them as a 'maintenance drug'. I am now 64 and did not want to just accumulate prescriptions because they were 'forever' drugs. I finally got off them with some withdrawal effects, but not as bad as the article. I have a new doctor now and when she reviews my meds she still asks if I want to go back on them. I have struggled a bit from depressive symptoms, mostly during times of stress, but have resisted getting a new prescription. I don't want to have to get off them again."
2347,Science,"A lot of people who have got a bipolar diagnosis after they started an antidepressant are not really bipolar. They got overstimulated and overly happy by the antidepressant, and because of this they were diagnosed bipolar.<br/>Often the problem with bipolar diagnosis is that then you get a lot of other drugs in addition, especially antipsychotics which reduce  life expectancy with 25 years on average."
2348,Science,"Veronica--it is not good, it is wonderful!  Not all doctors are trying to push medications onto people, but some of them actually know what they are doing, and they genuinely want to help their patients feel better, and not live in agony and despair.  There are physician-charlatans, (and there are noble physicians) and the drug companies have a lot of explaining to do about their excessive drug costs, but all I can say is THANK GOD these drugs were developed, so people do not have to suffer anymore with severe anxiety and depression.  I am sorry that some people experience side effects or withdrawal symptoms, but for the others, who would be in a living hell without the drugs...they are a God-send."
2349,Science,"Andy from Paris, that is incorrect.  A Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) is an inherited condition, and the anxiety is not situational or short-term.  It is a permanent condition, and GAD is crippling and unbearable to live with, depending upon the severity of one's disorder.  If someone has GAD, they may need to be on an anti-anxiety or anti-depressant medication for their entire lives.  Often the same medications that are used for depression are also used for GAD.  I will tell you that for someone suffering from GAD, to go off their anti-anxiety medication, and to then go back to the chronic, crippling fear and anxiety (often with panic attacks) would not be smart.  And it would be VERY unpleasant, and perhaps harmful or even deadly."
2350,Science,I told my doctor I wanted off because of the side effects you mention. Her first  suggestion was that I &gt;increase&lt; dosage! Blissfully ignorant is right.
2351,Science,"The problem is that there are no studies showing that psychotherapy will solve the problem either.<br/><br/>All that is scientifically known is that in SOME cases, psychotherapy helps.<br/><br/>That's probably because ""psychotherapy"" is a very recent Western invention, with not a lot experience yet, and even less scientific proof ... <br/><br/>Compare that to the neurological studies concerning MBCT as treatment for depression, and the difference is quite impressive. Unfortunately, what people associate with ""meditation"" is often so wrong that just the idea of it may frighten them, whereas only eight weeks of training already lead to measurable rewiring in the brain."
2352,Science,Thank you for writing this.
2353,Science,"I can't imagine why your patients would be ""okay"" with being medical guinea pigs. Is this the best you can offer your patients-""gee I don't know the long-term effects but here take this pill anyway, and by the way--you're on your own with titrating off the dosage with the 'help' of an M.D.."" No wonder people don't trust psychology/psychiatry."
2354,Science,"No, the converse question needs to be asked. Because I've heard innumerable people state that they had to return to antidepressants because ""the depression came back."" How often is that because of withdrawal?"
2355,Science,"Being yourself means feeling that you're connected to your own internal, emotional life, and know how to find purpose in your life.<br/><br/>You're no longer yourself once you get so disconnected, numb and desperate that you can no longer develop any of your own skills, let alone define a purpose and then organize your daily life in such a way that it can be linked to that purpose.<br/><br/>For some people, drugs are absolutely necessary to be able to be themselves, whereas for others, it's the exact opposite.<br/><br/>People with severe asthma for instance need drugs in order to function properly, rather than having to stay in bed all day and watch their life passing by. The same goes for depression."
2356,Science,"""Let's focus on the causes not the complaints..""<br/><br/>But the causes of the economic (and spiritual) disruption that has been going on for the last 40-50 years and have led to widespread depression have have no easy political solution (or NO solution!) So treating someone with anti-depressants that actually work can be very helpful.<br/>It's much easier (and usually more time effective and cost effective) to attempt to treat depression with meds rather than tackle the enormous time effort to go to a mental health counselor/psychologist/psychiatrist who may or may not be effective (not to mention the shortage of competent mental health providers.) Who has the time and money to go into therapy two or three times a week ? And more often than not, counseling is ineffective. I know this from being a front line primary care physician who has dealt with depression for years.  Most of the patients I have treated with low dose antidepressants have benefited from them, at least in the short term. And if they do go into counseling, the concomitant use of anti-depressants can increase the effectiveness of therapy."
2357,Science,"""This is drugs being prescribed by non mental health professionals, and then not being followed up appropriately."" No. You're mistaken. Some of us have taken such medications EXACTLY as prescribed, by MDs, expressed concern about possible habituation, been told it was nothing to worry about, got worried anyway, attempted MINUSCULE reductions, suffered severe symptoms, gone back to the doc to say ""What the heck"" and try to get some assistance, told that withdrawal ""doesn't happen"" when you've only been taking a small amount as prescribed for a short time, and strongly discouraged from attempting further reductions any time soon - if ever. Assured that people take the same Rx for years with no problems; also that - contradictorily? - it is only people who take the stuff for years who have problems, and so if it's only been a few months that just can't be what's happening - and/or, that it just isn't the right time to get off, and when the time comes, it will be a piece of cake. Let me repeat: This happened to me after taking medicine AS PRESCRIBED, by an M.D. with Ivy League credentials, while seeing a doctoral-level psychologist who has decades of experience treating patients many of whom are on psychotropic drugs. I didn't go to a fortune teller or a homeopath or something.  I've paid a fortune for the privilege of being ""monitored by mental health professionals"" with terminal degrees in their specialties and impeccable credentials."
2358,Science,"Likening anti-depressants to opioids, at least based on present medical science, is highly irresponsible. As for ""eternity"", the issue is that no one really knows whether it's a good idea or a bad idea. But I'm 26 years into an SSRI regimen and doing--compared to where I was in 1992 and before--just fine, thank you m'am. Where I was before was definitely a ""bad idea""."
2359,Science,"Have read 60+ Reader Comments &amp; started on NYT Picks. Here's what I see: most replies reflect 2-30 year views of psych treatments w/little awareness that psych Drs have debated treatments well before modern day ADs came along. Plus the newest ""AD""s now include ""atypical antipsychotics"" &amp; not just drugs like Effexor or Prozac. About 75 yrs ago the psych solution was asylum or sanitarium. And psych problems resulted from bad parenting. The side-effects of some atypicals are life-long loss of muscle control, aka Tardive Dyskinesia (TD). The info a patient gets, in plain English, is not the info the Dr gets. A patient gets a buried caution about movement disorder. The Dr gets an upfront warning about TD. Unless Dr reads research + footnotes, they are clueless re TD. Drug makers don't research withdrawal because their patents have expired.   Now the answer is CBT + meds. Try finding any legit psych who only does CBT &amp; not 10 other therapies. Drs no longer do therapy--they push pill cocktails they may invent w/o guidance. Stopping pills = fewer patients. There's so much more to this than quit/don't quit drugs or drugs good/bad."
2360,Science,Thank you for the reminder. The original population for which these needs were designed still have long-term needs and may never discontinue use.
2361,Science,"I got off Zoloft proscribed for GAD. Glad I did.<br/><br/>Doctors who make their living from prescribing drugs need to be more sensitive to their human tendency to see the world thru a lens that rewards them for proscribing drugs. <br/><br/>I find your views reminiscent of those my psychiatrist had. Reality is chemically based, and as doctor he knew best. Glad I got off him too. "
2362,Science,"Depression is NOT a ""life long battle"" for most people, and it is NOT akin to diabetes. For some people, yes, it's something that they'll have to battle long term. For most people it is not. The claim that people with depression necessarily require life-long medication just the same as people with diabetes is irresponsible and simply not true."
2363,Science,"Thanks for your story, mine is similar.  I will continue to work with body to discover the role of what I call genetic deficiency in my depression. To bad science can not answer that question for me.  "
2364,Science,"It is not unusual for physicians or researchers to not actually know how a drug works or predict possible side effects. This is not only the case for antidepressants but also other drugs like antibiotics. If you read the inserts for a lot of drugs you will find a section that basically says âWe donât know how this drug works. We just know it does.â So this is not particular to SSRI or SNRIs.<br/><br/>As for your lack of discontinuation symptoms once you stopped taking Zoloft, everybody is different. In short- you were lucky. "
2365,Science,"Dr. Garvey:<br/>Again, not all depressions are acute and self-limiting!  Some are chronic and they are not situational, but neuro-biologic, and incessant.  Most good practitioners CAN tell the difference between an acute, situational depression, and a chronic depression that one is genetically pre-disposed to, but which may have worsened due to a situation.  Although, sometimes it may be difficult.  Still, no one should have to suffer with a depressive or an anxiety episode...or a long-term, chronic condition.  Thank GOD that these drugs were developed!  More people suffered, and more people who needed these drugs, committed suicide without these drugs, before they appeared on the scene.  And NO ONE should hesitate to seek treatment for any kind of mental anguish."
2366,Science,"Cat--I think my depression began, when I was 14, and suffered a severe concussion.  Everything changed, for me, after that accident.  Edgy emotions, and new difficulty in learning."

How many people do you know have been robbed by antidepressant junkies in order to purchase the medications on the street?  How many article have you read about unethical doctors prescribing antidepressants for money?<br/>As to the first thing you say, every study on depression on this country say physicians underdetect it.  So you're unhappy when your doctors do their job and ask about it as they should be.  You seem to be someone who is searching for less competent physicians."

The next Senator from West Virginia was a man who was convicted in violating mine safety that resulted in the deaths of miners in mines owned by him.

Can also have leftovers the next day tossed onto a salad or chopped up and added to scrambled eggs.  "
2406,Dining,"I eat asparagus year round but the best is when I harvest it from my own Asparagus beds in the spring. Planting asparagus can be hard, and the wait is long. Three years after being planted,it is ready. (After 2 years you can harvest a little). Before my current beds, I had asparagus growing near my pool,under day lilies,a relative of the plant. I got the best from there. The asparagus was fat,tender and white. Unfortunately, one of my dogs, dug up the entire bed and even ate the roots! So now the beds are fenced in. 5 of my 7 dogs love asparagus and will wait while I pick it,for the ends. They prefer raw to cooked. The nice thing about really fresh asparagus is that you can just slice it up and toss it raw into anything. Iâm hoping for early May,but you never know. Last May, I harvested 7 lbs in two days,and then it rained so much It slowed down considerably."

2436,Obits,This guy was very very special. His music was the development of a new form. I wish I could have seen him perform.

The last time I saw him live, back in the early 2000s, I was still shaking my head in awe the next morning over his sheer power, technique and iconoclastic approach that still somehow told the story of where he came from musically. He was fearless and devoted. What else is there?"
2438,Obits,"I went to hear Cecil Taylor at a small venue in Philadelphia back in 1986. I had recently gone there to see Horace Silver, my favorite jazz pianist, and one of Taylorâs influences. Right after Horace Silver, I went to a performance of another innovative artist, Sun Ra. What a performance his band put on!<br/><br/>So I figured I had to go hear Cecil Taylor, whom I had never seen or heard. I was amazed at how his fingers moved over the keys. No one to this day have I seen who could play so fast! It was such a memorable performance that I immediately went out and bought one of his albums on which he performs solo. It is gratifying to hear that he lived and performed many years longer than most great jazz artists."
2439,Obits,"Thanks for the excellent summation of Cecil Taylor's life and work. He would be one of my heroes if only for his persistence in doing thing his way. Beyond that, his music enraptured me with its energy, imagination and its often overlooked links to the jazz tradition.<br/><br/>I recall an extraordinary concert in collaboration with AACM (Association for the Advancement of Creative Musicians) affiliated artists at Mandel Hall in Chicago in the late '80s. It was not necessarily a musically successful collaboration, but it was a supreme example of spontaneously creative interaction at the highest level. It was also memorable because my date literally fled the venue during a particularly intense passage. Powerful indeed.<br/><br/>Thank you, Cecil. RIP."
2440,Obits,"More than 15 years ago I came across a copy of ""The Great Concert of Cecil Taylor,"" a three LP Prestige box set of a 1969 French concert with Mr. Taylor, Jimmy Lyons, Sam Rivers and Andrew Cyrille (liner notes by Gary Giddins). In all the years since I have listened to it only once straight through, when the stars had aligned and it was the right time. I recently started reducing my music collection based on how often I have listened to any particular album in the past two decades. My one listen to this one matters not, it is one of those treasures that I will never get rid of regardless of how many times I may or may not play it, because when I am ready next, and I look forward to the day, he will be there to transport me like virtually no one else has and can.    "
2441,Obits,"One of the great artists of all has left us. What a tireless burning Spirit he was and will always be. Deeply brilliant, his accomplishments are stunning in their magnitude, originality, power and deep beauty. His commanding melodic/harmonic character (great dramatic lines, heart breaking melodies, angular propulsive phraseology), his feel for blues, and total passionate intensity is unforgettable. For all of us, it can be said there is much in his music and poetry (and his musings in the many published interviews he gave) to inspire us to better fulfill our creative and human potential within our own lifetimes.                                                                                      <br/><br/>One thing Cecil taught me is that it is more important to be playing from the basis of one's feelings than impressing audiences by being clever. There's much more to say, and those touched by his artistry will have their feelings to share and add to his life's work and legacy. His music changed my life for the better. Complementary to his artistry, and critical to his stature in the pantheon of the greats , was the tremendous will he possessed to be the greatest he could be and accomplishing this while being marginalized by critics, public and many musicians throughout the decades! The necessity to survive and the strength to witness the full flowering of his innovative rich musical language without compromise is yet another accolade for him that few others have attained. "
2442,Obits,"Cecil Taylor's music may not have swung in any traditional sense, but I found it thrilling.  I saw him live at an outdoor festival in Pittsburgh, where he alienated some minds and opened others."
2443,Obits,Will there ever be another Cecil as cool as Mr Taylor?
2444,Obits,"I saw Mr. Taylor and Jimmy Lyons at a rare concert during the '70s in the east Village. I expected it to be difficult, based on his albums that I owned.

2445,Obits,"I first encountered Cecil Taylor when I was a student at Antioch College in the early 1970's. He organized large student orchestras with himself as bandleader, conducting and performing. I was in the audience for two concerts, both of which went on for hours. They were like ultramarathons. Audience members wandered in and out, but I can proudly say that I stuck it out to the end. I had never seen anything like it. I have always thought of these concerts as models of dedication to the creative process."

2465,RealEstate,"Interestingly, my vet's office always has HGTV on the TV in the waiting room.  I find it mildly engaging while I'm there, but for me, my fave program that I could binge on for hours is the BBC series ""Escape to the Country"" (now available on Netflix and BritBox) and the side-series ""I Escaped to the Country"".  In the show, two people (typically a couple, or parent and adult child) have been living in some British suburb that has become too busy and crowded and they want to move someplace more rural.  One of the five hosts of the show meets the pair in the county of choice (they go anywhere in England, Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland), and proceed to show them three houses.  The first two hew very closely to the list provided by the pair (number of beds and bath, and any other wants like possible holiday rentals, stables, etc.) but the final house they visit - the Mystery House - is something against type, and frequently, the house that the pair prefer.  In between the house visits, the pair seeking to relocate will be introduced to some local business or artisan whose craft they have find interesting, and the pair get to try out sailing or weaving, while learning about the area.  I first caught the show a couple of years ago when visiting family in Ireland, and now I'm obsessed!  There's something so soothing and peaceful about the places visited (though the bedrooms  are generally TINY by comparison to US homes), I'm often tempted to pack up and go. Highly recommend!"
2466,RealEstate,"I used to like ""Sell This House""  on A&amp;E with Host Tanya Memme and designer/home stager Roger Hazard who helped homeowners who were having trouble selling their houses.  Lots of humor and realistic ideas.  Roger was a hoot."
2467,RealEstate,"I miss Candice Olsen.  Her renos were DIVINE!  No drama, just good design and explanations given for the choices she made."
2468,RealEstate,"I like Netflix 'Grand Design' -- it has its own drama but it's not of the sensational brainless type. Instead it focuses on the start and finish of one ambitious design per episode and of the people who make much personal investment (and financial too, often without borrowing) to see a vision or an odd lifelong dream come to fruition. Sometimes they're seizing a rare opportunity, like restoring a clock or water tower to live in. The homeowners do have their quirks and when you see some of the designs, you'll think some have lost their footing in reality. But the homes really are grand, many of them built with sustainable methods, and not all are large. Mostly I like how host Kevin McCloud, an accomplished builder himself, unabashedly asks about the budget at the start, inquires about money issues during the build, and asks how much they strayed in the end. Plus, he knows how to don a scarf :)<br/><br/>The show so far has run for 18 series (seasons) from 1999 - 2017. Sadly, Netflix only streams two."
2469,RealEstate,"Why build an enormous ""gourmet chef"" kitchen with a Wolf stove when all you will really use is a few square feet of counter space to unwrap your takeout?"
2470,RealEstate,"I agree with those below who note the drawbacks of open-concept kitchens, which offer no privacy and buffer from cooking smells.  And Susanna, who mentioned noise in open-plan schools.  On a recent Fixer Upper, Joanna Gaines did a questionable open-concept remake of her sister's new home.  The family now has six kids.  Can you imagine the noise bouncing off bare walls and floors, from clattering dishes and the normal screeching of children? <br/><br/>I want to mention HGTV's newer program, Home Town, a cut above.  The Mississippi-based couple, Ben and Erin Napier, are appealing, especially now that they are more at ease on camera.  Granted, they are starting with more charming housing stock than other shows.  But they try to honor the past and preserve what is there, including frequently leaving the kitchen separate.  Erin's non-trendy decor looks comfortable.  And Ben is an amazingly talented woodworker, creating beautiful heirloom-quality pieces from lumber often recycled from the project.     "
2471,RealEstate,"I confess to loving the shows. It's not the decor I like (Often, frankly, good for ridicule), but the construction details. Bricklaying is fascinating, and harks back to the Egyptians. Can they really raise that flat roof? What can be done with the cement block garage? Eventually, our old dump will need repairs, and I'll have a better idea what to expect.  "
2472,RealEstate,"Great column- so true!<br/>I watch a lot, it's my default. But I miss the very old days of HGTV, when they weren't focused so much on real estate.  They used to have many shows about crafts, and about do-it-yourselfers. Now it's become extremely repetitive and formulaic."
2473,RealEstate,"I don't understand the hate. My wife watches these shows, and she has the idea from them that she could do a lot of what she sees. So with no experience at all, I bought her a rotary hammer and wet tile saw, and watched while she tore out 600 square feet of tile and laid down travertine in its place. Then for last Christmas I bought her a compound miter saw, and she put up crown molding all over the house. Did a fantastic job, simply because HGTV convinced her it wasn't all that hard. "
2474,RealEstate,"An all-white decor, open concept kitchen is what it says about your moneyed class, a minimalism where people don't cook. The aesthetic to be achieved here is open the fridge and find nothing but mineral water, a bottle of wine, and leftover take-out, House of Cards coffee, a cutting board and an apple."
2475,RealEstate,"Dear readers who hate subway tile,<br/>I'm so ashamed about the subway tile in my kitchen! Please forgive me. "
2476,RealEstate,"Since late night hosts have become so political, I close out my night with a soporific episode of House Hunters on Hulu.  Anything to avoid dreams of DJT."
2477,RealEstate,"If the author was hoping to make me regret cutting the cable (three years ago), she failed. There's more great TV than I have time to watch via Netflix, Hulu and Amazon. And I don't mind saving $100 or so each month. "
2478,RealEstate,"Guilty as charged.  I watch HGTV as an escape mechanism.  It has changed tho, used to have more craft, quilting, home dec, garden shows, occasional rehabs whereas now it's all houses to fix, re-do, buy or sell.  Somewhat disappointing but still enjoyable However, still entertaining.  Aside from PBS, HGTV is my go-to TV when I'm not reading a good book."
2479,RealEstate,Double sinks in the master bedroom and granite and stainless steel appliances.  Stop being sheep people!    Itâs becoming boring 
2480,RealEstate,"What gets me about these shows is that they don't re-cycle, re-use, etc.  Everything goes in the dumpster.  Where do people think Joanna gets all her stuff?   One other thing:  I don't get double sinks.  I don't want to floss my teeth standing next someone shaving their arms pits or whatever."
2481,RealEstate,How about character and community.  I think those are the most common words used on House Hunters.  I still watch it though.
2482,RealEstate,"Stainless and granite are going to be the ""avocado green"" and ""harvest gold formica"" of the 2020s."
2483,RealEstate,Yeah and the History channel is now about everything but history.  There oughta be a law!
2484,RealEstate,And what about the lighting? You don't like the fixtures? Get new fixtures.
2485,RealEstate,"I love House Hunters International! I really do learn things about various countries when watching it. It's interesting to see what is ""normal"" in homes in other countries."
2486,RealEstate,Every show except Fixer Upper.  Have you noticed that there have never been any gay couples in Waco?  
2487,Washington,"Finally, some good news about Russia. These should be expanded and toughened, but also tied to specific behavior, like disciplining a child.<br/><br/>Is there a long term strategy?

2488,Washington,"If Putin really had something on Trump, how much will he endure these hits on his oligarchs, inclusive of his own son-in-law, before letting whatever roll out? Or maybe he is letting Mueller doing it on the money trail!"
2489,Well,"I'm not a doctor, but I will give it a shot. Recently I and and several friends had colds with coughs where long after the cold was gone the cough persisted for several weeks. Annoying, but not dangerous nor contagious. Don't take any medicine for it other than a cough drop or honey whatever you might find soothing.<br/><br/>On the other hand, when I had a horrible, non-stop hacking cough that brought me to the ER, I was prescribed Hycodan syrup whose active ingredient is hydrocodone. IT WORKS! Unfortunately, a second, non-theraputic ingredient, homatropine methylbromide, is added to prevent ""misuse"" (they don't do this for Vicodin, so why for Hycodan syrup?). I believe that homatropine is anticholinergic and there are may people who cannot take anticholinergic drugs (can cause urinary retention for those with enlarged prostates, for example). So an otherwise effective drug has been ruined for a large segment of the population."
2490,Well,"I use Life Savers during the day and honey at night. Someone from Copenhagen mentioned peppermint oil, which sounds like my kind of meds. Also if you keep a pebble in your mouth it helps the dehydration in the mouth and throat. "
2491,Metropolitan,"I used to love Mario Cuomo.  However, Andrew is a huge disappointment to both progressive politics and NYC youths.  Before retiring, I was a NYC BOE school secretary.  I live in Manhattan's Hell Kitchen and worked very close to where I live.  Most of our students were from poor neighborhoods in the Bronx and needed a metro card in order to get home.  However, the kids were complaining to me that their city issued school metro cards were not working and they were forced to jump the turnstile in order to get  home.  I didn't know whether to believe them, but they were kids who were poor and minority, so I wanted to give them the benefit of the doubt.  Sure enough, their school issued cards did NOT work!  The kids were being arrested, many were over 17, for trying to get home.  Cuomo could have helped the kids by allowing them to use other proof proving that they were students trying to get home.  Andrew Cuomo is awful, a Republican in sheep's clothing.  Shame on him.  Vote him out.  "
2492,Metropolitan,"If Cuomo were a progressive instead of an opportunist, he would have put the kabosch on the IDC years ago.  The 8 IDC members ran as Democrats and then supported Republican control of the Senate, as a result of which truly progressive legislation was killed in committee- and he had deniability because he could blame the Senate Republicans.  <br/><br/>The Reproductive Health Act (which would repeal NYâs laws criminalizing abortion - key if Roe v. Wade is overruled) is just one example, and tells us all we need to know about Cuomo and womenâs rights.  He doesnât want that bill passed because it would kill his presidential chances in the Bible Belt. The Senate also killed the NY Health Act, the NY Dream Act, and most importantly for Cuomo, ethics reform, because the biggest growth industry in his administration has corruption in Albany. Make no mistake- his denials to the contrary, the IDC is there because he wants them there.  They are now supposedly coming back into the fold, because after Nixonâs hounding him on the issue, he made it happen. In the past, he wouldnât lift a finger to make them act like Democrats.<br/><br/>Heâs also grossly anti-democratic with a small âd.â He prevented two special elections from going forward before the budget was passed, because he wanted to make sure he had a Republican budget.  How is that different from Scott Walker of Wisconsin doing the same - and being smacked down by a court for violating the constitution?  Cuomoâs no progressive."
2493,Metropolitan,"""Despite the aura of insincerity that some feel surrounds the governor generally ...""<br/><br/>This prompts me to work on my own aura."
2494,Metropolitan,"It's the mid-1980s and Andrew Cuomo, recently minted attorney has become an Assistant DA. Suddenly he's a partner at Weiss, Blutrich and Falcone. Going from criminal law to real estate law, is a bit like being an MD and suddenly going from podiatry to gastroenterology. Not to mention, he's barely out of law school (25 years old) and is suddenly partner. And then there's another little fact: Blutarch and Falcone acquires bank business--eg handling closings for Citibank etal. That's a gold mine that lawyers get through political connections.<br/><br/>Just a little something to consider about the nasty, vindictive political leader of NY State"
2495,Metropolitan,"Generally Andrew Cuomo is a conniving immortal politician. Heâs got nothing to offer either as Governor or President. Too bad, I was a big fan of his dad. Iâll give Nixon backed by Zepher Teachout a shot, Yes, I think I like her. "
2496,Metropolitan,"Just curious: what has Cuomo done to restore honest government in Albany? Getting rid of corruption was part of the original mandate, right? As for Gillibrand, she was silent on Esty in Connecticut. Al Franken, may or may not have deserved to stay in the Senate. He certainly wasn't the worst of the bunch. And he certainly didn't deserve to get run out of town without due process."
2497,Metropolitan,How is it that on the eve of the election il Duce is engaging in a flurry of activity? Where was he for the last seven years? 
2498,Metropolitan,"Cuomo will never, ever be President, take that to the bank.<br/>He did a lousy job at HUD. All of a sudden he starts visiting African-American churches.<br/>After all these years, he's now aware of problems at NYCHA.<br/>This guy is just a grandstander, what a fraud."
2499,Metropolitan,It's way past time for the governor to stop acting envious of the erratic but suitably progressive Mayor DeBlasio. This isn't the Trump campaign. You can't tease people and expect to win a primary.
2500,Metropolitan,"I don't like Cuomo's attacks on deBlasio but I don't think that it's fair to say they are aimed at emasculating him. NYCHA is certainly in bad shape but deBlasio is far from the only one to blame for decades real estate developers have had a love affair with politicians who wanted to see NYCHA fall apart so that they could call for privatization no one is more guilty of that than former mayor Mike Bloomberg, then the gentrification of NYC would be complete and he could take credit, he deserves far more blame than deBlasio, in fact when Bloomberg took office NYCHA was considered the best public housing in the nation, he purposely let it fall apart. "
2501,Metropolitan,I wouldnt vote for him if you waterboarded me.
2502,Metropolitan,"Andrew Cuomo wants to be President and he never will get there by dumping on NYC.  He thinks it makes him look like a centrist.  What he is is an opportunist.  If he really cared about the citizens of NYC he has had ample opportunity to help and support us.  Did someone say public transportation? Congestion pricing? Unfortunately, Cynthia Nixon is a little new at the game to be taken seriously for Governor.  I hope someone with more experience steps up to give Cuomo a run for the Democratic Primary.  "
2503,Metropolitan,I agree. It would be useful if the NYT did an investigation on how or whether people transition from public housing to other forms of housing.
2504,Metro,"My favorite memory of the Tartan Day Parade is from about 10 years ago. About a half dozen of us were there to see it and take pictures. Some marchers were throwing out big Scottish flags. We caught one and as the afternoon went on we got swept up in the excitement and decided to take the flag and join the parade. We marched the last couple blocks with the flag and some of us were saying, ""we better duck out before the reviewing stand."" But we were buoyed on by the cheers of the crowd and before we knew it we were at the end of the parade. The announcer said, ""Well I don't know who they are, but let's give them a big hand for bringing up the end of the parade!"" The cheers were deafening! "
2505,Metro,"LOL!  How I miss the full-hour Saturday at 10 on NY1, though.  Ever since the area got so crowded so we stopped going out Sat. nights (and also, theatre tickets just got so pricy at some point before 2010!), New York Times Close-Up at 10 on NY1, then SNL at 11:30 had been a ritual. <br/><br/>I hope the ratings keep the show on.  I keep running into fans of the show who watched it forever on NY1 who don't realize it's still on.  The NY1 replacement show is more hip, it seems, and I guess the only thing Spectrum sees as ""hip"" about my over-50 demographic is us hoping never to need hip surgery.  :("
2506,Well,"After three miscarriages I was diagnosed with a borderline auto immune clotting condition. When I got pregnant again, at some point the doctor suggested I take a baby aspirin once a day. That pregnancy went to term and my daughter is a healthy 30 year old. The condition I was treating related to the anticoagulant antibody. Maybe this information will help someone else. "
2507,Well,"Bali, seriously, Bali? What planet do you live on ? Infertility<br/>Is cruel and painful. It is wrenching to be robbed of something so seemingly natural. I remember watching newly born animals in the spring:horses with foals, ducks with hatchlings, the most exquisite white baby fox dancing in the sun, and not beginning to comprehend my shortcomings. I tried to put the baby fox in my car not realizing it would have been cruel. It ran . Infertility is a true heartbreak. You are never the same person. So give it a break NYT. Rape is not as bad, #metoo and all. Itâs biblical in proportions.<br/>I had my adopted daughter and later a son. All beautiful. But has its tentacles stayed with me? You bet.<br/>Nothing heals that kind of pain...even a trip to Bali. If only life were so uncomplicated. "
2508,Well,I read that sentence differently. I thought he meant it would have been OK to give up and stop trying for another child.
2509,Well,"I went back over the article to see whether the author had expressed any opinions about induced abortion.  I couldn't find any such statement.<br/>Therefore, your attempt to shame the writer for feeling bad about a miscarriage but not about a child he might ""throw into a dumpster"" is not only cruel but bizarrely inappropriate.<br/>Like the hammer who thinks everything is a nail, I guess anti-choice people think everything is about abortion."
2510,Well,"@Golf Widow: As someone who has also been through secondary infertility (with no second baby to show for it), I did not feel like this was insensitive or immature at all. I find that it's often seen as OK for women with primary infertility to feel the same way about people with kids that those with secondary infertility feel about those with 2+ kids.<br/><br/>Aren't those with secondary infertility entitled to their feelings of pain? I had both primary and secondary infertility (baby #1 took 3+ years to conceive). And I will say that primary infertility wasn't a challenge for me at all -- I was happy to hold other people's babies, get excited about friends' pregnancies, etc. But secondary infertility -- with multiple miscarriages (just like the journey to conceive the first) -- felt almost unbearable. <br/><br/>Also, I'm an only who is mom to an only. I totally get the whole ""full-time friend for our son"" comment. Especially today, when families are so busy and it's hard for kids to meet up with friends outside of organized settings. The current expectation (unlike in the 70s and 80s) is that siblings are your playmate. No playing outside (or inside) with the neighborhood kids. So being an only is much lonelier for my son than it was for me -- and it was so very lonely for me. I hated every minute of single childhood.<br/><br/>I took the author's ""variety of personality disorders"" comment to be nothing but hyperbole, so it didn't bother me on first read. But I agree with you that it is insensitive."
2511,Well,"Adoption is a minefield, lets be candid and not deceive people. The amount fo self selection that leads a woman to give up a child in the 21st century can only give pause.  Caveat emptor was never more appropriate. Its hard enough raising ones one biological child that will more likely than not , with your genes, start off life ok. Anyone who doubts this should talk to a judge who has served in any family court."
2512,OpEd,"Ted Kennedy did not go to jail, but I don't understand the assertion that he was not ""brought to justice."" The inquest, the grand jury, the hearings, etc., -- aren't they the mechanisms of justice?"
2513,OpEd,"It takes a jerk to follow a jerk. Nothing more here, folks."
2514,OpEd,"The Q Anon board directed me to this opinion piece, the tone of which I find hilarious considering how for almost two years now corporate media has been beating the dead horse of Trump Russian collusion while ignoring the Clinton/Obama Uranium One deal, the multiple assassination attempts against Trump and his family, or the millions Clinton paid for the bogus Steele memo that was the basis for FISA warrants and the real conspiracy theory passed on as news. I would say its ashame what has become of the NYT, but it has always been the mouthpiece of the PTB. Maybe you can rhapsodise about the merits of Ophrah or the Rock leading the free world, or give intellectuals like Jay Z and oped column so we all know how to think."
2515,OpEd,"It's not necessary to be intellectually challenged to swallow this type of nonsense but it helps. Back when Bush was illegally invading Iraq, Hannity wasted weeks guaranteeing his fans that a high level source would soon reveal that they'd found the elusive WMDs. A boldface lie that should have exposed Sean for the phony he is. But it didn't matter. To this day, there are millions of dummies who are certain the weapons were found. When it turns out QAnon is just another empty hype, the true believes will buy into a new hype about how crooked Hillary somehow managed to stop the truth from seeing the light of day. (If only she had a tenth of the magical powers the right gives her credit for, DT would be a happy memory of how close we came to being ruled by a halfwit.) "
2516,OpEd,"Thanks Ms. Goldberg.<br/>All this time I thought it was just plain old denial, when I still hear Trump supporters jump to his defense in spite of the daily chaos, childish tweeting, and unhinged behavior on display daily.<br/>This sounds like an Alt-Right version of ""Trump Derangement Syndrome"".<br/>But instead of anger from the left, it's a safe, fantasy world created by the right to justify their failed experiment in ""Reality Show Democracy""..."
2517,OpEd,"I watched someone close to me go through drug addiction, and thankfully, eventual recovery. This individual denied the extent of the problem, and blamed the frequent job loss and financial debt on people and events unrelated to the addiction. Eventually their circle of friends was replaced with more sinister characters whom supported the use of even more illicit and dangerous drugs. Those who deeply cared for this individual wondered with grave concern about how it would all end. What would rock bottom for this individual look like? Ultimately, there was a trip to the emergency room where in a near life and death situation, this individual achieved rock bottom. Only then was the extent of the problem realized and a the need for a change in life recognized. I mention this only because I see the GOP's infatuation with Trumpism to be similar to a drug addiction in the sense that it will only stop when rock bottom has been achieved. More is required from GOP leadership to push back on Trump, to push back on his autocratic tendencies, to push back on sinister advisors like John Bolton. There are no respected voices from the GOP, aside from Senators Flake and McCain who have  shown the backbone to push back on Trump. Unless rational voices in the GOP find their spine, and find it soon, I'm concerned we will quickly find rock bottom. And, it is frightening to consider rock bottom might look like."
2518,OpEd,"Not every ""authoritarian"" state is fascist. Sec. Albright should know this  reality. The only authoritarian country today that has fascist, that is, corporatist, economic structure, is CHINA, which barely gets a footnote. <br/><br/>The US historically has supported authoritarian states, whether for the purposes of access to materials and markets, or for ""allies,"" for example, during the Cold War. The despotism of Putin today is no more dangerous than it was during the Soviet Period. Russia is Russia, regardless of the form of dictatorship that the country has at any one time: Czarism, Communism, Putinism. <br/><br/>Every other country mentioned by Sec. Albright has had a history of authoritarian rule, some punctuated by periods of relative democracy. As well most current wannabe dictators had been elected in fairly open elections at one time. <br/><br/>If Trump wasn't mentioned in the article, there would be no point in publishing it, would there be, NYT? "
2519,Washington,"I actually think that might be true.  Suppose Trump put $10M in a slush fund five years ago for Cohen to tap to ""fix"" whatever needed to be fixed; don't tell me details, just make bad things go away and tell me when the fund needs more case.  Stormy's just one of many, but what makes her different is the reason Cohen paid her off--to keep evangelicals from knowing about her just a couple of weeks before the election."
2520,OpEd,The stock market appears to be run by a bunch of hysterics--I take it very seriously when the President's idiotic tweets directly affect my retirement account.  I don't have a pension or a rich daddy to count on when I am old so this constant stock market turmoil is really wearing on me.  I wish someone in the WH would set up a fake internet for Trump so when he is thumbing his dyspeptic tweets they don't actually go anywhere.  
2521,Investigative,"And Trump is considering Pruitt to replace Sessions as Attorney General? You can't make this stuff up! How could Pruitt even be considered due to his paranoid security demands and his blatant misuse of taxpayer's money for personal gain? Not to mention that he most likely is doing insider trading deals from his Superman phone booth in his office. Trump probably does not see the bad optics because he wants him to eventually fire Mueller, which Pruitt would do because he has no ethics.<br/>Pruitt does not deserve another job in DC. He needs to be sent home to Oklahoma in shame."
2522,Investigative,And all of this in addition to Pruitt's mission to eliminate every regulation possible so that he and a select few can make more money while polluting the country's water and air. 
2523,Investigative,"During the 2016 campaign, among the most often used promises of then candidate Donald Trump was that he's ""drain the swamp"" in Washington.  It's quite evident, but should be no surprise to those of us who know what a sleazebag Mr. Trump is, rather than draining the swamp he is managing to significantly enlarge it and exponentially increase its odor. Congress and the electorate must don their hazmat suits and do a cleanup ASAP before the swamp spills over to the rest of the country."
2524,Investigative,When you factor in the sirens and flashing lights and 20 man security details and special flight accomodations for fear of an antagonistic public and bullet proof desk and sound proof office and dismissal of those who question his supreme authority you have a picture of a mentally ill person..
2525,Investigative,"What's the betting: Trump flunky Pruitt will be gone by Monday of next week? Odds on, I reckon."
2526,Investigative,"The soundproof phone booth makes a lot of sense if you don't want be heard arranging your payment for bribes accepted and actions taken to conceal the transactions. Makes perfect sense.<br/><br/>After these cretins are kicked to the curb, maybe his soundproof booth and Ben Carson's dining set will be donated to the Smithsonian American History Museum...to be placed close to Dorothy's ruby red slippers."
2527,Investigative,"Good God, it seems like every appointee needs a federal investigator! The destruction of the EPA regulations is mind boggling. I feel like Iâm constantly watching The King of Scotland. "
2528,Investigative,Pruitt is an one man swamp and then some.
2529,Investigative,"I live in Oklahoma, and Scott Pruit is the devil incarnate.  Weekly, my house shakes from earthquakes caused by fracking, and there are cracks above the doorways from the quakes. Under his ""leadership,"" the gross production tax on oil and gas wells dropped to the lowest in the national at 2.6-3% (compare with Wyoming at 12%).Oil companies own many of the politcians in this state (why you're reading about the teacher's strike--which is not only for salaries that don't require them to take 2-3 extra jobs but also about inadequate books, supplies, even school furniture). We have water contamination from coal-fired power plants and from fracking; air pollution from carbon plants.  I love it here and I'll stay here, but all politicians have to do is wave a big shiny cross in front of people and they're cheered as god-loving, gun-loving righteous folk. Pruit's decisions will have the greatest impact on the future of human life (as well as other life) on this planet. The worst of the worst."
2530,Investigative,"Pruitt is criminally corrupt and ethically bankrupt. In any other administration a person who had done a tenth of what he is doing would be out on his ear. But clearly Pruitt is a big suck-up to Trump. He was hired to destroy the EPA and he is doing a great job (in a Trump world) of doing just that--allowing our water., land and air to become fouled and toxic--something it will take generations to undo. <br/><br/>The public needs to hound him out of office. Once again--pitchforks and torches are the only thing that will dislodge this total reprobate. If we don't he is headed for the AG office, and then we will really see what corruption means. "
2531,Investigative,Another Trumpenstein bites the dust.
2532,Investigative,"""The White House confirmed on Wednesday that it was conducting its own examination."" Sure. It goes something like this. Someone asks the administrative secretary of the White House travel office, ""So, do you think Scott Pruitt is a good guy?""<br/>""Sure, he was always nice to me.""<br/>""OK, then, that settles it. It's all fake news. Tell the press secretary to issue a statement."""
2533,Investigative,It does not surprise me that he wishes to have a bulletproof vehicle. Perhaps he knows that he has created a few enemies.
2534,Investigative,"Pruitt sounds like the personification of the ""swamp"" Trump was elected to eliminate. Why is this extravagance tolerated? Combine this with the toadying to industry demands and disregard for science and facts and Scott Pruitt should have been fired the day he was hired as an utter incompetent but he's still in office. Why, Donald? Does he know where the bodies are buried or does he just have too many big donor friends?"
2535,Investigative,"This is corruption at the highest level . The people did not vote for this ! So , don't believe the voters will stand behind these crooks. Seriously !!"
2536,Investigative,"No money in the nationâs budget for healthcare, but perks for the Trumpies are all okay. Pruittâs gimme, gimme, gimme attitude was inspired by his boss who has vacationed about a quarter of the time heâs been in office, all at taxpayers expense."

There was the late Rob Porter - the wife- basher, the late pro-Nazi White Supremacist Bannon, Wilbur Ross-the money launderer, Betsy DeVoss - the education destroyer, Nikki Haley- the war monger, , Gina Haspel the torturer, Ben Carson the furniture buyer, ..this list goes on and on for pages: the people surrounding Trump that are just as evil and as incompetent as he is. We know that every day will bring us more gut-wrenching bad news about what is happening to our country. We cannot expect any of Trump's hand picked to lift a finger to help our nation, only to feed off the public trough. We also know that the only way to restore some peace of mind is to throw these all Republican anti-patriots including Trump, Ryan, McConnell and the Republican servants of the extremely rich out of Washington by turning out the vote in every election going forward. "
2539,Investigative,The Swamp is full to busting at the seams - what a national disgrace this administration is. <br/><br/>Every meaningful position is staffed by heads determined to make their own agency imploded - reaping taxpayer kickbacks during the entire descent. 10-person security detail for the EPA chief? First class travel....to where again? <br/><br/>You're spending MY money. MY hard-earned dollars Mr. Pruitt. <br/><br/>Get. Out. 
2540,Investigative,"Is Pruitt a cabinet member or a mob boss? And, is there any difference between the two in the Trump administration?"
2541,Investigative,The Entitlement Administration has struck again. Tax the peons. Make them pay for the perks of Leadership. Lie to them. Job done. 
2542,Investigative,Trump is doing exactly the same with backdoor deals. they are the swamp.
2543,Investigative,"These people honestly believe they are doing nothing wrong.  Go to What church does Scott Pruitt belong to,,and you will find out scads more.  "
2544,Investigative,...and CONGRESS needs to answer why TRUMP still has a job!!!!!
2545,Investigative,"Applying rational thought, I see. It doesn't work in this context. Trump put Pruitt there to make the EPA toothless and ineffective."
2546,Investigative,"What, may we ask, do you know of environmental science and ecology? What course in that area have you had?"
2547,Investigative,In the swamp.
2548,Investigative,"Just being fair &amp; Oklahoma is part of us, despite Pruitt."
2549,Investigative,And a few floors down from his office there actually is a soundproof room to make calls.
2550,Investigative,"Go to the comments section of Daily Caller or watch Hannity. The base is behind Pruitt, they think this scandal is all the work of the ""Deep State"" out to get him and Trump. "
2551,Investigative,"Shouldn't there be, instead, some way of removing such officials when their actions are so opposite to the mission of the agency they lead? Need to rename his office, the Environmental Predation Agency. He's better suited to be Sec. of Energy. To think he visits coal mines and oil and gas fields speaks volumes of his priorities. Can't believe he can't be removed for dereliction of office. But, then, Republicans love to hamstring environmental policies. Once children are out of the womb, they are on their own and need no more Republican protections."

2555,Well,"Legalisation is coming here soon, only weeks now, but users have already assumed it has arrived. One distinct downside is everywhere on the pavements, in bus queues, at pedestrian lights, in the parks, someone is smoking a joint. We managed to eliminate public smoking and it is banned here in parks, at beaches, etc. only to have a new epidemic of weed smoking worse than the cigarettes and cigars of the 1970s. To say the acrid stench is unpleasant to all and dangerous to some (COPD, asthma) is an understatement. The attitude and behaviour of the new stoners is unbelievable, as is their sense of entitlement. The studies of driving and accidents associated with cannabis are also chilling -- now we have legions of stoned drivers on the congested and already dangerous roads. I never thought decriminalisation would make my environment so much more unpleasant and dangerous."
2556,Well,The only time I ever heard of anything like this is people who eat to much. Like the whole pot brownie instead of a couple bites. I have been smoking weed on and off ( mostly on ) for around 45 years and never experienced anything like this. And neither has any one I know. 
2557,Well,"Sessions, the FDA, and the DEA are desperate for reports of ANY side effects of MJ, however incredibly rare, in order to justify its continued placement on Schedule 1 and to avoid decriminalization which would lower the profits of the private prison industry within America.  Shameful! "
2558,Well,"I don't believe this report.  Have smoked it for 50  years, quit it many times for weeks even months, never experienced any of what this article describes.  Eases my arthritis."
2559,Well,"Nothing is 100% safe or without adverse reaction so it is no surprise that some will have a reaction to marijuana. Some people are allergic to shellfish, some to nuts. The real issue is figuring out what you might be having a reaction to.  Unfortunately this individual did not make the connection or try to rule out what he was imbibing."
2560,Well,"I know or have known a significant number of users over my 56 years of life on planet earth. Sorry, none have had this affliction. The honest truth."
2561,Well,"It may not be a perfect drug, but marijuana/thc is still much safer than alcohol.<br/>The epidemic of alcohol use and abuse hasn't had to be swept under the rug because the society simply has come to accept All of it's side effects, including thousands of alcohol related deaths due to vehicular accidents. Not so with marijuana.You have seen or read about inumerable brawls and worse due to alcohol, not so with marijuana.<br/>This story explains a relatively small negative facet of chronic heavy  use of marijuana. Equivalent use of alcohol would result in cirrhosis of the liver.<br/>Of course, ideally, with sufficient research funding, the efficacy of marijuana could actually be studied and determined. But in our 18th century Republican kleptocracy, science is a fake alternative to religious truth."
2562,Well,"This does exist for a small percentage of people.  It's very real and the only treatment is to stop. It's cyclical vomiting and the brain keeps telling you its time to throw up again. I'm not a pot smoker but I get a similar syndrome, Hyperemesis Gravidarum from being pregnant and spent two pregnancies vomiting and being hospitalized. The pregnancy hormones tell my body to do this for the first 20 weeks of pregnancy just like marijuana tells their body to do it. I learned about the marijuana version of it at the hospital.  During my pregnancies I heard from hundreds of people, ""This never happened to me when I was pregnant... you must not want to be pregnant... you're doing something wrong..."" The narcissism of some of the comments here reflects why our culture is such a mess. If it ""Doesn't happen to me it can't be true,"" syndrome seems pervasive.  I thought smoking pot was supposed to make people more accepting and loving. The lack of empathy in some of these comments is truly shocking. "
2563,Well,I thought the percentage must be high also until I spoke with affected patients in legal states who told me it has become very common
2564,Well,"Reply to chas - That comment about memory loss was a predictably cheap shot. It illustrates the antipathy to cannabis that still pervades many areas of US society -- as if a history of smoking pot somehow invalidates a person's perspective. Like many commenters on this article, I'm pointing out the questionable reasoning employed by the author, as well as the potential for fear-mongering inherent in the article's claims. (And I have a very good memory.)"
2565,Well,"""It's a caused by all cannabinoids .""<br/><br/>Very doubtful and another reason to suggest a great deal of caution in drawing conclusions from this study. Different cannabinoids have vastly differing effects. No buzz at all from CBD, but really helpful with joint and nerve pain. Etc, etc for more than 40 more...<br/><br/>Again, I don't doubt that this problem exists, just am very skeptical of the supposed pervasiveness of it.<br/><br/>Better science will likely find that CHS is largely a matter of the effects of certain cannabinoids. Find cannabis with those adjusted out genetically through breeding and I'll bet this is a very manageable problem.<br/><br/>BTW, I wonder when we're going to hear about a similar study on alcohol. I doubt any drinker would claim they've never heard of booze making people chronically nauseous. No, not saying it's the same as CHS -- except for the puke itself I suppose.<br/><br/>This is good info for doctors to know. It fails as badly as the more familiar excuses used to prop up prohibition when contextualized in perspective. In fact, it's probably an argument for the safety of cannabis if it turns out some people get pukey over it is the worst health effect I hate puking with a passion...but like to keep things in perspective."
2566,Well,"I don't get it. Why keeping smoking, if smoke freaks you out?"
2567,Well,"I believe the point made in the article was that it took some time for people to realize that the pot was what was causing the symptoms - hence all the tests.  Many sufferers had been smoking heavily for years without these symptoms, so when the symptoms showed up, pot use was not among the first suspects.  You wouldn't be taking tests to find out what was wrong with you if you already knew."
2568,Weekend,I take issue with this movie. Iâd like my money back. This is an awful movie. Lots of vomit.  
2569,Dining,"In a pure Keynesian economy, which is what we're purported to have, this would all be a non-issue. Wages would rise until the demand was met. But in our surreal economy, employers make incongruous statements like âWe donât win them over with a paycheckâ. No, I wouldn't think you would, as scale is about $2.05 now, and no worker is paid more than another (aka, communism). Oddly, CEO's are lobbying to lower the Federal min wage for these workers? Food service worker pay is higher than other industries in perhaps one case- migrant farm labor.<br/><br/>In any other industry this problem wouid fix itself, as CEO's would tell HR until attrition slowed. I know that, having worked in corporate management for fortune 500 companies for 35 years. The minimum it takes to put workers on the floor is what a company will pay.<br/><br/>Except food service- they''l apprarently pay LESS than the minimum it takes, based on this article.<br/><br/>Oh and for R Kelly, and others ,who believe  its NOT about the cash? Do an experiment, tell workers starting next week, all work is for no pay. See who shows up. As we scientists like to say the two are highly correlated (pay and filling positions, and attrition)."
2570,Dining,"Today's labor market is clearly creating havoc with these jobs.  Restaurants now need to establish their employee value proposition from minute one in the recruiting process.  Today's applicants are no longer interested in searching job boards and completing text-based applications to find out if the company is a fit.  They want video, they want interaction, and something quick.  These restaurants appear to be changing their culture after hiring, but they really need to change their hiring practices so they will have the best candidates to choose from.  There are tools out there that would let restaurants create a paradigm shift in their hiring practices so they would be able to pick from the cream of the crop."
2571,Dining,I'm surprised that nowhere in the article did it mention losing undocumented workers due to fears (and raids). Undocumented workers make up a large percentage of BOH positions in the restaurant/hospitality industry and the reduction in that workforce has had a huge impact.
2572,Dining,"I think the best place to start is by recruiting and hiring high school students and college freshman to fill some of these lower level positions in restaurants.  There are thousands of high schools here that have an adequate amount of supply.  If you train these young adults right, then they might just stay on with a restaurant for the long haul.  "
2573,Dining,"Follow the Costco method:  Pay a living wage, benefits, health insurance, and paid holidays."
2574,Dining,"Notice the NYT doesn't utter one word about illegal help being scarcer since Trump took over (I hate the man but here we see the rubber meet the road). Here where I live in NC help in Restaurants is scarce too.<br/><br/>With lines out the door you know darn well these Bosses could charge .25-.50 cents more a taco, (nobody would bat an eyelash), and pay a fair/great wage.<br/><br/>We've always heard ""But you'll pay more for your food, service, groceries, etc, We need dirt cheap labor."" Guess what - nobody really cares or notices. They want Tacos.<br/><br/>Now we are seeing how a race to the bottom on wages is being removed, wages have to right themselves and trained American workers of all stripes get the jobs at a decent wage."
2575,Dining,"Let's get it out in the open. Food service is hard work and people don't get paid much for the physical work and crazy hours/shifts involved. I worked briefly in high school and vowed to myself, never again since making someone's food is a personal and intimate process. TV and magazines have made the food industry look glamorous but the behind the scenes work is like a marathon.  "
2576,Dining,"I wondered, when I chose this story to read, whether it would have any mention of migrant workers. I live in an area that has depended on workers sent over in an entirely legal program to work on farms. The workers were paid well and were housed in dorms that the federal government had oversight over; if so much as a battery in a smoke alarm went out, the farmers were fined.<br/><br/>If this kind of labor shortage is affecting urban businesses, maybe there is hope that their grumblings will help deeply rural areas like the one I live in. Commercial farms here (locally based family companies) are hurting for loss of workers who used to be brought in during the growing season under federal oversight. <br/><br/>Americans didn't want these jobs. But the jobs certainly paid better than Walmart does and had perks such as housing.<br/><br/>Those days are gone. The recent focus on eliminating foreign workers has ended a program that no one here objected to, and I assume restaurants are undergoing the same shortage.<br/><br/>As to restaurant workers being exploited: I worked in restaurants for three years between getting my bachelor's degree and beginning my master's, first as a cocktail waitress, then as a bartender. I made good money, and the money I saved helped a lot during grad school. I don't ever recall feeling exploited by restaurant work."
2577,Dining,"Working in a restaurant is tough. One unavoidable problem is working nights and weekends, especially every Friday and Saturday night when everyone else is out having a good time, especially when you are young."
2578,Dining,"When I was a student in Germany, I waited tables in a local Kneipe.. SSometimes I had to halp out in the kitchen, too. I worked many hours - tipping is not customary. But I loved my job. The owner always gave me free meals. When nights were good he gave us a bottle of wine to take home âand relaxâ. I was paid a decent wage and had vacation days and sick days, health insurance - AND respect. I have tried working in gasronomy here. I have a culinary school diploma as a chef. What is lacking here is respect for professionalism from the owners and the customers. "
2579,Dining,"Having worked formally in the restaurant industry for many years, most diners would not go out and eat in restaurants if they knew exactly what is going on in the kitchens.<br/>It is not savory to divulge how awful working and sanitary conditions are.<br/>Most, I'd say 50% of eateries are abysmal. The workers are treated so poorly that it is reflected in the way things are done back of the house. Why should they care? I mostly eat in. Rarely do I venture into 90% of restaurants."
2580,Dining,"If your business model does not include paying your workers a decent wage or having to depend on employing illegals, then change up your business model.<br/>WAAA! So tired of hearing about the money grubbing owners, (mostly investment groups), crying about lack of staff. Properly PAY PEOPLE for their HARD WORK! Really, is it that hard to understand? "
2581,Dining,"It seems like the national association really needs to educate the public on the costs of running a business and what the margin needs to be to pay its employees a living wage.  In the meantime, service unions and pro-immigration organizations can publicize how little most food service jobs pay, to combat the knee-jerk ""they're stealing my jobs"" cant."
2582,Dining,"Wow, after reading that I'm sure glad I cook 99% of my meals at home. Seems I'm just missing out on unskilled cooks and bad wait staff."
2583,Dining,"Well, we can either continue to encourage unrestricted illegal immigration, or we can start offering real wages for the very real work of working in a restaurant.  The elite have long enjoyed fancy meals at bargain prices, at great social cost to our society.  Time to pay up!"
2584,Dining,Why not offer jobs to unemployed coal miners in West Virginia?<br/>They could commute to DC.
2585,Dining,"Actually Spydo, you might want to read my comments a little more carefully before making your own and criticizing others. I did not indicate that its ""NOT about the cash"". In fact my comment was that employers need to pay a FAIR wage. In my opinion, FAIR is determined by a combination of many things...job performance, business market conditions, labor market conditions, regulations etc. <br/><br/>What I am trying to indicate is that the issue is not a single plane issue but is multi-faceted and that many if not most commentators in this string suggest it is a singular problem and solution....painting ALL food industry business owners with a very broad brush.... the classic stereotype of the rich business owner living a lavish lifestyle while paying slave wages. <br/><br/>Any person on either side of the argument can show examples of unfair or unethical behavior....employers who do not reward consistent good work, reliability etc and employees who shirk their jobs, call-out at the slightest whim, don't make efforts to complete their duties. I've witnessed both.<br/><br/>I'm curious how many businesses you've risked starting, how many jobs you've created for people,  how many team members whose lives have been lifted by your efforts.... to give you such knowledge and experience. <br/><br/>It comes down to one thing, if someone doesn't feel they're getting paid enough, they can find another job. If it happens enough, a savvy employer will realize they need to address the problem because turnover costs $$."
2586,Dining,"Indeed.  One of the things I have liked about traveling in Japan and Korea is that you don't tip anybody for anything, ever, as far as I can tell.  Service workers like waiters, cabbies, hotel staff, etc. are paid a reasonable wage to start with.  Yes, it makes the prices a little higher, but as you said, no math to figure out afterward and the price you see on the menu, or the taxi meter, is what you actually pay.<br/><br/>(That said, when I travel abroad I make sure to find out what the local tipping norms are, so I neither over- nor under-tip.)"
2587,Dining,"$17 an hour for entry level work that doesn't require college education isn't bad. The lack of takers isn't a population growth issue (or lack thereof) though. <br/><br/>The problem is that everyone from genX down has been sold on higher education being the only path to success. We were considered failures for not having one. $17 an hour blasts the minimum wage out of the water, but still doesn't pay for those student loans. This is what happens when people are told to get more education if they want to make more money, rather than minimum wage keeping pace with inflation. We reap what we sow."
2588,Dining,"We used to have a nice place here called Anderson's. The owner was ""Jimmy""/ (real name Demetrios Andropoulos, ""Dimmy"")<br/>The waitresses were the oldest to be found in the entire city. Jimmy said some of them had worked for his father right out of high school. They all wore Enna Jettick shoes. When they retired or died they couldn't find anyone to stay long and eventually closed. "

2590,Foreign,China vs. United States in a trade war will be like a<br/>Robot Army vs. Herd of Cats<br/>We don't stand a chance of winning.
2591,Foreign,"The present scenario was somewhat predictable when China entered the WTO on December 11th 2001 under the Bush administration.<br/><br/>Diplomatically, they have worked to counter US influence in SE Asia with notable success. Thailand edges closer and Cambodia is already in China's camp and even once staunch US ally, Philippines strengthens economic ties and dials back security concerns in South China Sea. Only Vietnam is recalcitrant. If I were Xi, I would give something on South China Sea to Vietnam, China wins much economically with treaty over sea with Vietnam than military bluster and bullying. Ply Vietnam and Philippines from US and Xi has virtual checkmate of US in SE Asia. 500 million added to a Chinese style EU. The question is can China reign in its hubris and opt for a soft hegemony of the region."
2592,Foreign,"China can easily switch to other markets. They are cheap. America can't do the same because its products are expensive. But apparently Trump didn't get this into his brain.<br/><br/>The worst thing is still to come. When markets are switched, it is very difficult to go back to point zero. Besides, this takes quite a long time, enough to ruin the economy......of America."
2593,Foreign,"On the one side the Russians, and on the other side the Chinese.<br/>What a brilliant log jam and strategy for such a smart man!<br/>Will there be anything left in 3 years from now?"
2594,Foreign,"China must be gleefully watching Trumpster and his minions drag the USA down into their ethical and chaotic cess pool.<br/>What better helper than Trumpster's behavior against ""free trade?"" To work towards unknown and misunderstood domestic and international objectives; Trumpster surrounds himself with fellow cowards who'd rather fight than peaceably negotiate and persuade via rule of law.<br/>China selectively rewards or applauds the variables (such as provincial agricultural interests) in the US business and political system that work to China's advantage (but not always to the USA disadvantage).<br/>Rather than build cooperation among allies, Trumpster blusters and threatens spreading suspicion and distrust among USA's European and Asian allied leaders and citizens. He promotes armed soldiers ""defending"" USA Southern borders from defenseless refugee/illegals. Plus his ""untruths"" (aka lies and contradictions) that unsettle diplomats and citizens, alike.<br/>Trumpster befriends a ruthless Russian dictator who manages assassinations in our allie's nation and who invades and seizes land that he wants.<br/>With ""friends like Trumpster"" China doesn't need any more help; our POTUS is doing it all for them, eh?<br/>One can place USA first and still accommodate allies and friends..I remember Truman and Ike post-WWII and into the Cold War.<br/>If one could write a play about USA vs. China where USA loses and China wins a trade war, wouldn't Trumpster be the ""ideal"" POTUS."
2595,Foreign,"MPA....""China has us at a competitive disadvantage. They sell more than they buy from us.""....You have it exactly backwards. Because they sell more than they buy, they have an excess of U.S. dollars. In the end either directly or indirectly, the only place you can spend a U.S. dollars is in the U.S. . Think about that. China is the one that has the bigger problem."
2596,Foreign,Since when could you only spend US dollars in the United States?  Last time I looked you could spend them in any country in the world.  For now anyway.  
2597,Foreign,"What you've done is called creating a straw horse, a focus around which you conduct a rousing argument but based on something that doesn't exist. Your agenda is to foment anger at liberals for what they are not doing. Liberals have not been rooting for China. They are rooting for the American worker. Just this morning pbs had a program about Midwest soybean farmers. We are trying to protect America against a more than incompetent president who threatens war on all fronts. Trade against the world and China. Atom bombs against North Korea. He is an idiot and yet you libel those who try to protect you from his idiocy. I Or do you really want both wars?"
2598,Learning,"Based on the graphs, I notice that the artists shown are the artists that are the most popular in their genre, and each genre differs popularity in differnt regions. Rihanna being a mostly R&amp;B singer has higher popularity in the southeast. Drake being an artist in the hip hop industry has the highest popularity in the in the southwest, Taylor Swift being mainly pop has the highest popularity in the west and Midwest, and Luke Bryan being a country singer is the most popular in the mid-Atlantic right between north and south east. These regions are completely different indicating that one genre is more biased in a specific region."
2599,Learning,"I notice that some parts on the map of the United States is a darker shade of Purple, while others are lighter in certain areas. I wonder why only these 4 artists were chosen out of the Top 100 artists, and if it were chosen at random to display these specific artists. What might be going on in these graphs is for each artist being seen on Youtube, they get more popular, but in each state the amount of viewer is different depending on what is actually trending in that area. "
2600,Learning,"I notice that Taylor Swift and Luke Bryan are the most liked from the whole of united states more than Rihanna and Drake. Taylor Swift seems to have the united states like her the most out of Luke Bryan, Drake, and Rihanna. From the west to midwest to the north east dont seem to really like Rihanna all that much, she doesnt seem to have majority of the states liking her. "
2601,Learning,Drake is more popular in the famous cities and popular cities like LA 
2602,Learning,I notice that in this graph they show each of the artists popularity.<br/>I wonder what the author of this graph is trying to say.<br/>In these graphs i think that they are showing us how race is shown by having popularity mostly where they come from.
2603,Learning,I noticed that Taylor Swift has a darker shade of purple that's bigger than other artists. Something that I wonder is what do the numbers next to the names mean. And I think this graph is telling us how artists are more popular in certain areas. 
2604,Learning,i noticed that taylor swift is more popular than drake. i wonder why because in my opinion taylor swift is trash. a story this graph is telling is that country music artist are more popular.
2605,Learning,I totally agree that genre of music does have an effect on the popularity of an artist in certain areas of the United States. 
2606,Learning,"I agree that the popularity of the different artist depend upon the different regions in the United States. For example, look at how popular country music is in states such as Montana, Wyoming, Utah, Idaho, and Colorado. While the popularity for rap resides in  Louisiana, Alabama, Missouri, and Georgia."
2607,Learning,The people who are not watching these 4 artists are watching other artists on youtube. The graph is based off the streams off of the youtube geocaode streaming data period and took the geocoe for these 4 artists.
2608,Learning,"These are good questions, Michael.   Do you have any idea as to why a certain artist is more popular in a certain region?"
2609,Learning,"Good morning, Jakeila.<br/>How did you come up with âthe story this graph is telling is how people of color are more popular in southern areas and how white/Caucasian people are more popular in northern areasâ?  Without backup from noticing what is in the graph, this is an opinion.  If you tell us what you notice in differences in the graphs, you can claim this distinction.  Claims can be more convincing than opinions.<br/>Let us know what you find!"
2610,Learning,"Jordan â Hope you see this reply since you responded 18 hours ago.  <br/><br/>You say that you âwonder why Taylor Swift is the most popular.â  Think about what âpopularâ means in these graphs?

In fact the President did wear an Afro in the 70s -- many of us did at the time.<br/><br/>All that being said, women are judged on what they look like.  As someone who considered cutting her hair when I came out 20 years ago, I say Right On, Emma!  <br/><br/>I chose not to cut my curly hair because it is my only sign of Blackness (I'm mixed and look white).  That being said, most people wouldn't see it that way but I do.  My black curly hair came from my African American Dad.  <br/><br/>Hair is a statement.  Emma is making hers.

2628,OpEd,"The point: each President follows a bell, an internal one that rings. Each leader rings a bell, one that summons society. American leadership is a tale of two bells, two narratives; one that looks forward to wider opportunities; one that looks to power and places barriers to progress. But new bell ringing relies on deception; it peals that barriers are progress, that limits increase everyone's chances, that inclusion is not winning, that deception is no different than any other bell.<br/><br/>Trump is a blind mule following his instincts. He has bells in his head. It is not reasonable to measure him by reason or rationality, but to see him exactly as he is. <br/><br/>Wishful thinking is winsome, but it suffers from the same flight from reality that signifies Trump. Brutal honesty removes the barriers to clarity, not musings or sensitivity. Brutal honesty tells us Trump loves the alarms, the bell ringing of power, money, greed, ego, and bragging about empty victories. It's time for us to stop repeating the obvious.  The bell of liberty demands we take a stand (make a plan!) to vote him out and rang a new bell of honor and wisdom, of peace and prosperity, different Pavlovian harmony."

2630,Metro,"âAnd the camera in the 15-square-foot elevator has become a daily reminder for parents to not leave their children unsupervised, even inside the building.â<br/><br/>Why is that so far down in the story? I grew up in the 1960s, and even back then I would not have been allowed â at age six or seven â to take elevators unsupervised, or play in the common areas of an apartment building without being under the watchful eye of someone who was at least in their teens. In the environment of a an urban housing project, and one that was already known for a high level of violence, this seems so obvious. But itâs true everywhere. In 2015, here in California, a nine-year-old girl was playing alone and unsupervised right outside her apartment complex, in a paved plaza. A neighbor that she knew me considered to be a friend invited her into his aparrment for ice cream. He raped and killed her. This was in an arts-themed complex where residents (some of them artists with on-site studios) felt they had a special community bond, yet the crime still happened. Why? Itâs hard to hear, but children aged six, seven and nine are not old enough to be left to their own devices. They are too young and vulnerable. They are defenseless. What would a security camera have done for any of these three children? It would have helped to identify the perpetrator, certainly, but it would not have saved their lives. "

2641,RealEstate,"Not sure about this. I mean, yes, we should be learning about other people and where they live. But I don't think it's as different as you imagine in some ways. People in cities have more options for eating, but many people still choose to cook. I live in Chicago (within the city itself, although not downtown) and there are two grocery stores within walking distance, one of them only about 10 mins away. Also, many people drive or take public transportation in Chicago. I don't even live downtown and I know that there's a Mariano's downtown that's very popular and that big Walgreens sells food too. It's not uncommon to have a grocery delivery service either. I remember being somewhere in the city this past year - can't remember exactly where now - and looking down the street and seeing a Whole Foods, and then looking down the same street the other direction, and seeing another Whole Foods. So there are grocery stores. We almost never go out to eat, preferring to cook and eat at home with our family (plus we couldn't afford to eat out all the time). I used to live in a small town in the midwest, and honestly our life is pretty much the same now except it's more of a hassle to do certain things, and there are more interesting things to do. It's harder to get out into nature, but there are more, and better, parks. Our apartment costs more, but our groceries cost less, and we make more money doing the same jobs."

2648,Upshot,"Regardless of which tit for tat moves will be taken by the US or China during this trade war, one thing is certain: prices will go up for all consumers. The era of inexpensive goods may be coming to an end and since our economy is largely based on a consumer economy, this may be a rough adjustment for most of us."
2649,Upshot,"who knows what will eventually happen with our putative tariffs (not the White House spokeswoman)... but in the immediate term, they are having their desired effect on the Trump base while at the same time providing the uncertainty and chaos slick financial operators (paging Wilbur Ross!) can exploit.<br/><br/>my bet: if some or all the tariffs do not go into effect in several months, Trump's supporters will think they did, because he announced them.<br/><br/>and, they also get a FREE PONY! "
2650,Upshot,"There is one other issue not discussed here. Tariffs on raw materials raise the cost of products manufactured from those materials. That means high steel costs created by tariffs make US exports made of steel less competitive. I am not sure that the higher cost of soybeans is going to make many Chinese products less competitive in the world market. <br/><br/>In other words, this may be an asymmetric trade war. Domestic political considerations play a huge role in the US choice of trade targets. Its not at all clear that is true of China, despite the speculation here. Instead, they may choose targets that have little impact on the cost of exports at the expense of higher costs for their domestic consumers. That would certainly be consistent with their history."
2651,Upshot,"""The details of what China might do are speculative.""<br/><br/>Its all speculation, but don't let that stop you.  <br/><br/>But it ignores China's ability to influence our other trading partners.  If this becomes a full scale trade war as speculated here, there is no reason to think other countries aren't going to be forced to choose sides. In a single global market, you can't put tariffs on goods from one country. China is not going to let countries import soy beans from the US while selling their own soybeans to China sans tariff. <br/><br/>It steps around is the reality that much of what we import from China is produced by and for ""American"" companies. It ignores the huge amount of US capital that is invested in China. China has been a huge drain on capital that otherwise would have been used to invest in US production. The finance industry depends on that market. Without it, the value of US capital is diminished.  "
2652,Upshot,"David Ricardo made international trade sound so simple, didn't he?<br/><br/>Win/Win, and all that.<br/><br/>Turns out it's rather complicated, with ""unconventional weapons"" and what not. <br/><br/>Perhaps it's time to update the economics textbooks?<br/><br/>But then again, it would be kind of awkward for economists to admit that the economic theory that has dominated the 21st century has been wrong the whole time. <br/><br/>Dead wrong, in fact. <br/><br/>And it has been responsible for a tremendous amount of suffering for the American middle class, as a result.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the global unrest and suffering we're just beginning to experience as a consequence of this flawed academic economic theory is going to intensify, which will further discredit Ricardo, and modern economics in general.<br/><br/>So there may be no need to update those textbooks, after all. <br/><br/>We can just burn them. "
2653,Upshot,"The reason Chinese continue to buy US Treasuries is to maintain their currency (RMB) in a peg with the US Dollar. <br/><br/>Therefore, if China stopped buying US Treasuries, the value of the RMB would appreciate vis-a-vis the US Dollar gradually. This would automatically begin to close the trade deficit because it would make Chinese imports more expensive in the USA. Americans would substitute away to cheaper products. <br/><br/>If China stopped buying US Treasuries that would help Trump achieve one of his aims here -- i.e., making the trade deficit smaller. "

You may want to force a connection between love and evolution, but that is just as ""fundamentally"" mistaken a projection of your own need to limit love to a linear, rational ""intention"" in the species, as those whose religion dictates that people get married to continue the species according to their god's plan, desire and demand. Too sort sighted, self-important, and self-righteous, Mohammed: Love is to love; anything that comes out of that, whether it is collateral damage or collateral benefit, is not part of its purpose.

Along with his war on mass media 'fake news' attacks Trump has proven to be far smarter and tougher than his foes.<br/><br/>Trump rationally believes that appealing to his supporters fears regardless of facts and reason is the root of and the route to continuing to occupy the White House until and beyond 2020.

2710,Business,"If Trump really wants to protect America from economic invaders, he could focus on the importation of services, especially technology services, via outsourcing.  He could place a tariff on outsourced labor-based services in which the labor is based overseas, or brought to the U.S. via temporary work visas.  Outsourcing work to cheaper labor is also an economic disruption."

2714,RealEstate,".<br/>About a year after my mom sold the family home, and moved to be closer to one of my sisters, I was in the town I grew up in - Towson, Maryland. I drove by ""home"" on the way to visit a friend; the garage door was open --- maybe they were home?? <br/><br/>When I knocked, the lady answered and I said ""this might be a huge mistake, but my name is Susan Baughman and..."" she let out a yell and exclaimed ""oh!

2715,RealEstate,"It's quite old-fashioned to live in the same home for decades and then pass it on to your child, that's why I like the concept. Somehow corporate America has convinced us that if you don't move around the country on a (their) whim, you are a loser. I like my deep roots and how those roots anchored my children. I consider giving them those roots--as opposed to a rootless existence in some soulless suburban outpost where families transfer in and out every few years--one of my best moves. I don't consider them to be members of the ""lucky sperm club""; in fact, I am quite proud of being a middle class American who has worked her whole life and is able to give her children a bit of a leg up in the world."

You can pay the property and inheritance taxes but, quite mysteriously, there will be no record of it. <br/><br/>The other scenario: The house and property might be yours, but don't turn your back; you might find that, when you return, the stone wall separating your land from the neighbor's has inched closer to your house, and your neighbor's field suddenly has more space.

2718,RealEstate,"It isn't corporate America, it is deeply American to move and frequently. We move less often now than we did 100 years ago.

2721,RealEstate,"That seems to be one aspect of the situation, i.e., that people cannot afford to buy out their co-owner relatives.  (I don't think anyone expects that their relatives who own shares in a home would give it to them any more than they would anticipate that their relatives who each inherited $$ would simply pass that along.)<br/><br/>However, it also appears that a goodly number of these homes need work, so that even if only one person inherits, they still have to sell because they can't afford the hundreds of thousands of dollars it would cost them to restore the place.<br/><br/>Finally, there's the issue of where the house is located versus where the person who inherits is living.  If someone has a life in Southern California, they may not want to re-locate to the Northeast just because they happened to inherit a home there."

2723,Business,"Eduardo Porter in his recent NY Times economics column (02/14/2018), analyzes why wages have been stuck, with little growth recently.

And competition, in the United States, is shriveling.""<br/>In this study by the Washington Center for Equitable Growth, ROIs to stockholders for investments in capital besides labor have soared. The lack of competitive pressure has allowed firms to: ""set prices more of less at will."" Unrestrained by market forces: ""They pad corporate profits and send stock prices sky high.""<br/>Porter attributes this uncompetitive environment to:<br/>1) Firms like Facebook and Google that may simply have the employees and deep pockets to ""out-innovate everybody"" and that can maintain ""monopoly control over their latest innovations.""<br/>2) Much like big contribution margin ratios can be an indicator of market concentration, so too do current large profit margins of the S&amp;P 500 firms in themselves, signal concentrated, less competitive markets.<br/>3) Barriers to entry prevent Schumpeter's ""creative destruction"" forces from eating away the ""rents,"" or excessive ROIs currently accruing to larger firms.<br/>4) This market concentration results in more oligopsonistic worker purchasing power by these firms in labor markets.<br/>5) Productivity lags as active investments are discouraged to protect current cash flows.<br/>[4/6 11:38p Greenville NC]"

2728,National,"H1B abuse is real. Anybody working in IT knows it and the many first-hand comments on this page show that.<br/>An H1B visa is not a family visa. It is a visa for one person for one job. H1B is not a passage way to a green card. If H1B visa applicants do not understand that then maybe they need to better educated. Abuse of the system by large Indian outsourcing companies should not change make us question our laws - it should make us enforce our laws. Unfortunately the tech lobby is very strong in preventing that.<br/>The simplest solution would be to limit H1B to Masters degree and above of fully accredited foreign universities. That would prevent half of the abuse (as already described in several comments).<br/><br/>Second, once approved for a green card the applicants enter into the quota system for green cards and the long waiting period is a simple result of Indian applicants outnumbering the quotas for India - nothing else. This has been in place for decades. Mexicans have no chance of receiving a green card once approved for example, approved applicants from Lithuania, Germany, or Namibia on the other hands just wait 1-2 years. The quotas are set to keep the immigration pool into the US diverse. What is wrong with that? The issue now arises since Indians far outnumber their allotted quota due to the H1B abuse.<br/>Again, change the program, help skilled US labor, and in turn those approved for green cards from India will wait a reasonable amount of time as they did before."
2729,National,"Remember you may get problems by hiring an American worker, but you get no problems from hiring a cheap foreign worker.   <br/><br/>Cheap foreign workers are like serfs."

2731,National,"No sympathy here.  These women are married to husbands who have taken the jobs of Americans through manipulation of the immigration laws by Indian outsourcing firms.  Having personally spoken to fellow employees who had to train workers frpm an Indian outsourcing firm which will remain nameless, I stand firmly behind a reduction in H1-B visas.  Even the Times has written about this very issue. Then, their wives can have anchor babies and stay in our country forever.  Cry me a river.  American jobs for Americans.  <br/><br/>And no, I did not vote for Mr. Trump."
2732,National,"Itâs not discrimination and itâs not unfair. The US, like any other country, can set any immigration quota they would like. Part of the reason the wait for Indian nationals to gain a green card is the rampant abuse of the H1B visa. Without the gaming of the visa system, thereâd be fewer people here in the first place. This horrific abuse, mostly by technology âbody shopsâ has done much to harm the types of skilled workers that the visa program intended to attract. <br/><br/>If youâd like to complain about the wait for green cards for people from India, I suggest you look internally â youâve done it to yourself. <br/><br/>As an aside, itâs infuriating when foreign nationals complain about our immigration laws. If you donât let me them, you can always leave. "

Nothing against the Indian employees themselves, but clearly the outsourcing company could have hired the displaced American workers rather than bringing in Indian replacements who were cheaper.<br/><br/>Jobs in the service center of Disney did not require ""the best and the brightest"" which is why the outsourcing company was hiring cheap, rather than hiring experienced American workers.<br/><br/>Working as an analyst for an insurance company does not require a STEM degree or a biochemistry degree.

2739,Travel,"I collected travel snowdomes, the ultimate kitschy souvenir. I have hundreds. Note I said, ""collected"". When I was young, the plastic domes all had the ubiquitous blue background, 3D molded handpainted panorama with city label. Most were assembled in Hong Kong and eventually China. I thought of a Chinese worker carefully arranging the memories, e.g. a camel, pyramid and the requisite snow together and then moving on to say, a surfboard, sand and plastic seashells. Did they dream about these faraway places or did they think it was consumer junk? Anyways, snowdomes became modern and precious and looked unintentionally more tacky: glass domes with gel, glow-in-the-dark holograms, flashy sparkles, flat printed images instead of figurines. It wasn't fun anymore to ask my friends and family to search out my desired snowdome on THEIR travels (although many stories returned with the object about the elusive hunt). Now I am 60, decluttering, no longer collecting snowdomes on travels only memories. Except perhaps while wandering antique malls and spotting a faded gem like an old friend."

We were expected to have collections in the 1970s--I collected porcelain dogs, license plates and all things music; my sister collected rug hooks and souvenir spoons. It gave us something to buy (read: at which to throw away money) when we visited a new place, and helped to guide the purchases of our relatives at birthdays and holidays. It was mindless, superficial, impersonal and wasteful. My daughter, who is kindergarten, was told by her school during the first week of school that she needed to start a collection (of 100 objects) as a way to practice counting. There was a celebration on the 100th day of school, and everyone brought in their collections. "
2744,Travel,"I challenge the author's opening quote. Our parents â and everyone else we see â teach us to acquire through their every example.

However, afterward, I discovered that I savored every experience for itself, no longer concerned about finding the best shot.  (Also, taking photos of local people turned out to be a serious affront in most countries we were visiting.)  When I spent a subsequent year going around the world, starting in the South Pacific, I didn't weigh myself down with a camera.  The experience was enough.  I could sen d postcards if there was some interesting place to share with people back home.  Also, in many countries, often I was hosted by local people who frequently took group photos, sending me copies. <br/><br/>I pity today's travelers, saddled with cell phone cameras and the obsessive need to send or post photos of themselves, their meals, their views, even their hotel interiors, to all their friends and acquaintances.

But - at most - they account for 5% of the population of NYC, and for too long they've gotten 30%+ of the ""ink.""<br/><br/>Just as NPR now has a show broadcast from Gowanus, the NY Times does well to provide Brooklyn-centric coverage wherever possible. It's not (just) about which boro has 90% of NYC's cool at the moment - it's where their readers and future readers live.... And increasingly WORK!<br/><br/>Thanks for a great article - and don't forget, too, that there are neighborhoods with less name recognition than Park Slope - places like Kensington and Windsor Heights - that have stories equally colorful and worth telling!!"
2757,Metropolitan,"Nice article, thank you. Odd that it was about a cell-phone shop, but I guess such atmospheres can pop up anywhere where there are people interested  in people, not just the paycheck. I especially liked the closing paragraphs, ""She knew too much"" is a wonderful line that says so much."
2758,Learning,I disagree with what ms. robinson says because not being nice isn't going to make people or if you are nice they are still going to be the same. Just by being nice isn't going to change a person. Instead they  should consider how those students are feeling and find a way to help them out. 
2759,Learning,"A student cannot âstopâ a school shooter. Psychopaths do not feel empathy for other people, they are callous, cruel, and do not care what others think. They can never be cured of their disorder but can manage it through professional help, which is part of the reason I agree with Ms. Robinsonâs views on the situation. Students are not professional counselors and therapists and should not be tasked with the responsibility of being them to unstable kids.<br/><br/>Furthermore, Mr. Pettyâs #WalkUpNotOut tweet sounds like more of a stand against bullies/a stand for eliminating exclusion than it does against school shooters; kids who fully intend to seriously injure or kill their fellow students. Dealing with a psychopath is different than dealing with a normal bully, for one is solved through anti-bullying campaigns and counseling, while the other requires psychotherapy and (in some extremely serious cases) institutionalization to be contained. <br/><br/>The schools we attend have so far failed to identify and give proper treatment to individuals who display psychopathic tendencies and are mentally disturbed. If the government really wants to stop school shootings, they need to provide funding to the necessary departments and programs to carry out these actions AND make it harder for a mentally unstable teenager to get their hands on a gun in America. Until then, I would rather speak up and let my voice be heard, than shut up and quietly hope not to be gunned down in a high school hallway."
2760,Learning,"""Walking up"" is sure a whole lot better than ""walking out"". Although you can clearly see that Mr. Cruz is mentally ill based off of Ms. Robinson's article, it is still okay to go a little out of your way to talk to outcasts. The bottom line is, it is the people that kill others, not guns. Someone needs to pull the trigger. If someone is mentally disturbed, they should be put away and get help. It is pointless to walk out, nothing is going to change. Walking up can make a difference though. Being nice can really change someone's whole day, which obviously can alter outcomes of others lives. Walk up because then you are at least attempting to make a difference unlike walking out."

2772,Metro,"Given all the possibilities of our high-tech world, it would seem a good idea for the policemen who patrol the streets and neighborhoods in the community policing program to build up a database for the area they police noting persons with mental problems, shopkeepers who have their finger on the pulse of a neighborhood, etc.  Then when 911 calls come in someone (in the dispatcher's office? the police dept.?) could log into the database and call up information about the community/neighborhood that would help responding offices not normally assigned to the neighborhood to get some idea of what normally goes on in that neighborhood.  The database could include photos of individuals with mental problems (if that's legal) so officers could recognize them.  Etc.  All of that could be an offshoot of the community policing program.  It would also serve as a resource for officers when they are assigned to a new beat."
2773,Metro,"A man is dead,  the department has defended the spontaneous reaction, and the  failure to fully implement community policing,   means  the racist legacy of Stop and Frisk  persits.   Worse,  Thrump keeps the uncertainty of who is safe and unsafe high and fearful."
2774,Metro,"Tragic.  But after seeing the video and reading the text of the call to the police dispatcher, how could anyone fault the police for what occurred?  I am by no means suggesting that other high profile incidents involving the police are not troubling and even infuriating, but this isnât one of them.  People in the neighborhood called the police and asked for help and reported a gun in the hand of the suspect.  The police responded as I would have expected under the circumstances.  "
2775,Metro,"Simply tragic.  <br/><br/>That surveillance video shows a very troubled, very aggressive young man with something that sure looks like a gun.  I do not know what the public, or the officers could have done differently in the moment.  Hearing about the trauma he went through, it is also questionable whether there was anything to be done mental health services.<br/><br/>A while back, I knew a similar young man who smoke too many bath salts; his brain was quite literally fried from the experience.  He would give hugs.  He would also try to pick up (as in, grab them around the waist and lift) young women to molest them.  When officers would arrive, he would run.  The officers in my town had no idea what to do with the poor guy, not for lack of trying.  He was attempting to commit sexual assault, so they had no choice but to keep arresting him, often with physical (but thankfully not lethal) force.  Long term, there was nothing mental health could do because his brain was damaged beyond repair.<br/><br/>I am not sure there is a larger takeaway from either case.  They are the cases that are simply tragic.  Nothing more."
2776,Metro,"That's not an excuse. The question is why we allow police officers to use deadly force so quickly and why we condone cases were they clearly (so often) escalated the conflict (created it in fact) so that they could justify using deadly force. The fact that these same two basic scenarios play out across America, daily, indicates that it's a universal problem with a fairly clear solution."
2777,Metro,"Apparently, the person that called the cops didn't know who this mentally ill guy was that was ""lunging at passers-by.""<br/><br/>Trying to turn every single police shooting into a cause celebre is why people shrug their shoulders when they hear news like this..."
2778,Metro,"That's why there are specified tactics for dealing with such situations. How about taking cover and attempting to use a Tazer? Obviously, no shots had been previously fired by the victim.  Officers are way to quick on the trigger these days. They shoot first and ask questions later. <br/><br/>I wouldn't give up your pro-citizen stance when it comes to police shootings, just for this case. This is a very bad shooting on the part of the officers. "
2779,Metro," ""obviously?"" Do you know it was obvious to the responding officers that no shots were fired? That's a mighty dangerous and ill- informed statement. "
2780,Metro,"Ever hear of ""police tactics""?  Taking cover? Tazers? Talking the man down? Smh."

2782,National,"Wow, the Russians have really stepped up their response on this article."
2783,National,"Why are these illegal border crossers not being returned to their countries of origin?  Why are they allowed to just 'disappear' into thin air here in the United States?<br/>More sternly,  why aren't the leaders of these nations being called on the carpet for their poor treatment, poor civil management of their own citizens which causes them to flee in the first place?    <br/><br/>This problem needed solving thirty years ago.   NAFTA obviously didn't work as intended,  and I dare say,  has made this mass immigration actually worse.<br/>Sadly,  I don't see anyone in either local or national politics reaching out to our Central American neighbors in attempt to demand change.   Thus,  the only way to get through to these failed Latino leaders is-  keep sending their own citizens back to them.  In droves.       "
2784,National,I remember this ridiculous argument being supported when JFK ran for the presidency. This argument included having the Pope live in the US because JFK wanted him here. He did not come! Most RC's in this country do not treat The Vatican as a foreign power undermining our democracy. They would not support such a claim.
2785,National,"to the poster saying that organ transplantation is rare: I agree. but how about this-37%of all kids on Medicaid are Hispanic.  Hispanic kids constitute 25% of ALL US kids but a bigger number are 'on dole'. so much for the hard working, self sufficient alibi for these illegal immigrants."
2786,OpEd,We can't know what our ancestors would have done.  What I can say is that there is a long history of firearms ownership and regulation in America.  Many of the proposed fixes have either been tried before and didn't help much or were ineffective.  About half of the population is in favor of firearms ownership and about half opposed.  Neither side has the support to overcome the resistance of the other.  The solution is a compromise.  By that I don't mean what gun control groups propose.  They too need to give some things they desire up.  I don't know exactly what the compromise would be but I do know is that no one will like it but it will be better than what we have now.  
2787,Business,Trump and his advisors are manipulating the market. The SEC should start an investigation.
2788,Business,"The Trump limbo rock continues.<br/><br/>How low can he go?  And low as we let him go?<br/><br/>Hey business-oriented Republicans, is Mike Pence looking better and better all the time?<br/><br/>Wouldn't you feel more comfortable with a seasoned political operative in the White House instead of an overgrown child?<br/><br/>Are you really prepared to let him do for our economy what he did for his casino business?  "
2789,Business,"Bluffing is for losers who are afraid of hard work. When a foreign country owns alot of your debt and is therefore in a position of strength, you are not going to scare anyone. On a smaller scale, Trump's gambit is basically be akin to an ordinary citizen in this country telling some mega bank like Citi or Chase that holds his/her mortgage that unless they lower the interest rate, he'll file a lawsuit or otherwise try to find a way to penalize the bank monetarily. To which we all know that the bank would pull out the contract, lawyer up a little, and pulverize whomever tried such nonsense.<br/><br/>It's taken some time, but people are finally realizing that all the magical plans that Trump was so secretive about during the campaign are simply a figment of his imagination, and won't work.  "
2790,Business,We are all cut throat competitors. 
2791,Business,"Wow Juan, good comment. I am surprised at the average American's thought that somehow, now, we are in some wonderful world of a one world utopia."
2792,Business,"It is not China that is trying to divide the US and Europe and Rest of World.  It is Donald Trump who is doing so, since he came on board, and enunciated America First, withdrew from TPP, Climate, etc.  <br/><br/>Of course, it is not America First which is foremost to Trump, but Trump First.  What America needs to do is to get rid of Trump and get back to normal, and rational.  "
2793,Business,So who is preventing from doing it? 
2794,Metro,"I am sorry but there is not justification for the killing of this person. Why on earth can the police shoot to the leg or the arm of the ""suspect""? Just like the other case where the police were called because ""someone with a gun"", how can they not learn from that? Or the little kid walking around with a fake gun and killed right when the police got to the place he was, without a chance to tell the police it was fake?? I am sorry but the Police Department either does not care of the past or does not want to change, but they should know better at this point. I can keep mentioning case after case and most of them on my opinion are not justifiable.<br/>Again, maybe the PD should focus on training on how to immobilize suspect instead of how to just shoot and kill and then ask questions. And the irony of all this is that after all four cops shot him, they went on to try to save him. Why did shoot at the same time so many bullets? they should be given a suspension or at least send them back to training for a few months. The PD have to stop making this killing like part of the process of being a cop. The guy was sick just like the old lady killed in her apartment a year or two ago. Either they learn or they are out. "
2795,Metro,"Is this how NYPD, police officers around the country are trained? To shoot to kill? 4 police officers shooting at 1 man is an execution whether or not he had a gun. 4 police officers, 4 guns vs 1 mentally ill man with a shower head is excessive force. Couldn't 1 officer shoot him in the leg and take him down? Or shoot him in the arm and disarm him? What about tasers? These officers will say they feared for their lives but should we have police officers who are so easily frightened? Should we have officers who can't tell the difference between a phone and a gun or in this case a gun and a piece of old shower head? So yes, fine, 4 people called 911 on this man but a 911 call doesn't always have to end this way but increasingly, for Black men &amp; women, they do. "
2796,Metro,"Numerous cops shot 20 times, hitting with 8 bullets, a fleeing suspect in the dark who'd been breaking into cars, took a tire iron the the back door of his grandmother's neighbor, and then refused to THRICE disobey police instructions. That Sacramento repeat felon would still be alive had he not chosen to break the law and then had he not chosen to disobey police instructions when apprehended. "
2797,Weekend,"Cannot give it more than  3/5 stars and that is generous. These Jurassic Park raptors have traveled through space but can't see, the family is seemingly the last alive on Earth but electricity is still available. They eat well though. They all have to risk going to town to pick up a bottle of pills. The newspaper clippings assert that neither bombs nor bullets work but the shotgun seems quite effective. Perhaps a gun with a silencer would have done even more good. The people know the creatures are very sensitive to sound but never tried the Mars Attacks! Slim Whitman record until the end of this movie?  And sometimes it is about the nail !!!"
2798,Weekend,"Proving that the best tricks are the oldest, the nail causes more suspense than the creatures."
2799,Weekend,"""The creatures are blind, hungry and navigate by sound....""<br/><br/>Well, two out of three. On his whiteboard of notes Lee wrote ""why don't they eat what they kill?"""

2801,Weekend,"Well, it's already made a ton of money so we've got to start thinking about sequels.  I'm guessing that in the next installment the creatures will be frightened of noise and will  be hunting down their victims at libraries. "
2802,Weekend,"We just saw this today. Loved it!<br/>No gore, no sex scene, not even the F word. I must have jumped 10 times. We fell in love with the family, all of them.  Dont overthink the plot! If you want a break from miserable weather, and sit on the edge of your seat the entire time, go! "
2803,Weekend,"This is why, if I really want to see a movie, I don't read reviews (or killjoy comments with bonus spoilers) until I've done that. It's more fun to read reviews afterwards, anyway. "
2804,Weekend,My wife and I saw the movie and really liked it except for the ending that reminds me of the comment that today a problem with movies is that the directors don't know how to end a movie.  This one is lives up to that comment.
2805,Weekend,"This movie starts off with the quiet horror of a young child being snatched, builds momentum to an almost unbearable level, and then in its last third explodes into Munch's ""The Scream"".  Not for the weak of heart.  It, however, remains logical and coherent in plot and character throughout.  By the end you deeply care for this family and the heart wrenching experiences they endure.  But do all monstrous  creatures today have to resemble ""The Alien"" and does the mother have to turn into Sigourney Weaver at the end."
2806,Weekend,"Extremely disappointing.  Yes, I'm in the minority, old enough to remember classic horror movies from the first Halloween to works of cinematic art, like The Exorcist.<br/>This movie is about nothing.  No meaning, no subplot to carry a theme -- instead a series of events that ends with a nod to ""mom power"" a la Alien -- wherefrom this movie steals its monsters, too.<br/>It's very boring for its first half, relying on an occasional jump scare.  Some are decent -- with monsters -- others silly, as when one family member bumps into another.  Acting is very good, though the appeal of the kids may vary.<br/>SPOILER QUESTIONS FOLLOW:<br/>If bullets work against the monsters, why don't they use guns prior to the end?<br/>If mom and dad can talk freely when they're with the baby under a mattress in the basement, why don't they go down there earlier and talk as a family, instead of staying mum at every meal?<br/>Where does all that water come from when mom is flooded in the basement?  From one washing machine?<br/>Why does that baby almost never cry?  Why, in an attempt to quiet the baby, doesn't mom put it on her breast and start feeding it?<br/>Where does dad get all that stuff to build hearing aids, and all those monitors, and all those red lights if he's a farmer?<br/>If the timeframe of the movie is more than a year (confirmed by the day count) how do they plant and silently harvest all that corn?<br/>Proof again that wandering out to the theater for a ""good"" movie is a fraught exercise.  Go Netflix/Amazon instead."
2807,Weekend,"It seems that John Krasinski has create a movie not so much science fiction as allegory. In our contemporary world of internet trolls, online shamming and doxing, anything you say - or even imply - can be used against you, sometimes to lethal effect. "
2808,Weekend,"I saw this tonight and the production values elevated it beyond the typical âend of the world / monsterâ flick. Horror fans should like it - the creature effects are very good - and, if youâre looking for suspense - itâs unbearably tense. One thing I completly disagreed with? (If you read the review this was already mentioned so itâs not quite a spoiler - but if you did not, stop reading.) The pregnancy. I get that it could have been an accident but in an environment like that, one would think they would be very careful: babies cry a lot! Overall, a good, tight, short (!) movie. "
2809,Weekend,"Spoiler Alert: But this is the only way to respond.<br/><br/>You wrote that after data makes his choice (ie., dies to divert the monster away from his children), there's no place left for the filmmaker to go...<br/><br/>Here's what happens next: the daughter figures out how to use a high frequency hearing aid noise and amplification to disable the monster that is stalking them, and the mom shoots it in the head with a shotgun, killing it. The video cameras then show other monsters running to the house (attracted by the shotgun blast). The daughter glances knowingly at the hearing aid and microphone and turns the amps up to 11, and the mom reloads the shotgun (ca-chank!) with this ""bring it"" look on her face.<br/><br/>You must have seen the same film I did. Perspective is an interesting thing - I really am bewildered by your comment that the film has nowhere to go after the dad is dead because the women can't fight for themselves in their limited gender role. That seems like... well, the absolute opposite of what happens in the film. "
2810,Weekend,"Jeez, relax. In this particular movie, the family happened to be white. John Krasinski and Emily Blunt happen to be white, ergo, a white family. And I guess a farm family since they are at the farm on day 89, though we see from headlines that the cities are devastated, so maybe they escaped there. They are pretty much on their own, so there is not much opportunity for multi-culturalism. We see from the fires that there are others in the distance, but where there are more people, thereâs more noise and a chance of someone getting you killed. There have been horror films that were urban and multi-cultural, like âAttack the Blockââthis just didnât happen to be one of them.<br/><br/>But I will give you thisâas beautiful as Harvey Moon is, I wish they had danced to something a little more soulful like Stevie Wonder or Aretha Franklin.  That would have much less expected."
2811,Weekend,Whatâs wrong with more Ripley-style heroines? Sheâs one of my favorite characters in all of film. Women are really not such wimps as Hollywood has portrayed them.
2812,Weekend,"I was referring to the corn shown in the grannery scene . Fair point about the corn plants growing in the fields. Perhaps they set off a ton of fireworks when harvesting  to mask the tractor's sound !? Maybe they did harvest by hand ! I mean heck, they showed the dad sprinkling sand on  the trails  they walked on to deaden the sound of their footstep for goodness sake !!! Harvesting crops manually....sure I'll buy that too :-) !!<br/><br/>As for the water, eats me as well  ! No idea where it came from <br/><br/>Cheers"
2813,Weekend,"While that allegory would have been interesting, there's no convincing evidence in the film that supports a connection between the horror of sound and the dangers of expression in the Information Age. The thin, expensive, and vulnerable premise of ultrapowerful sound-hunting robots produces the tension and stakes the audience expects from a horror or thriller, but it doesn't interact with the human and emotional narrative told throughout the film. The film seems to explore the ways guilt, trauma, and stress impact family. I'd be interested to see if someone can make a compelling argument as to what it specifically explores. I just don't think the Information Age is present in the movie."

2817,Editorial,As far as I'm concerned this has gotten as bad as it is because the press has simply wimped out.  When Kellyanne or Sarah boldly lies to the camera and the microphone they are allowed to do so.  The press may discuss the lie after the fact but the damage has already been done.  Republican voters only hear the lie.  The lie is not discussed on right wing media and Republican voters only listen to right wing media.  The WH press briefings are a joke.  I realize those present are required to tow the line in order to have a seat in the room but those briefings have now become totally pointless.  They are embarrassing to even watch.
2818,Editorial,"What we are seeing in Trump and his constant bashing of the press and, for that matter, the rule of law, is classic fascist doctrine. First, you use the legitimate tools of democracy to gain power, i.e., free elections, then go about weakening the very safeguards of democracy: the rule of law, the free press and an independent legislature . Since  his campaign started, Trump has constantly used every opportunity to assail the rule of law and the free press press. As to the legislative branch, the chirping of crickets one hears from the Republican controlled congress in response to Trump's attacks enables and emboldens him to greater heights. Hopefully, the November elections will slow Trump's attacks or stop them completely, that is unless Trump finds a way to suspend or delay those elections under some guise. And don't say it cannot happen here; it is already happening.  "
2819,Editorial,"Whether any actual collusion existed or not, Vladimir Putin couldn't have imagined in his wildest dreams the gift he's been given with a Trump presidency.

2820,Editorial,"    What a predicament, having a dedicated liar in the Oval Office, for whom any news not praising his insolent nonsense is called ""fake"", a huge disservice to the dedicated journalists informing us about  the facts and the truth, at times even at the risk of their lives. Trump does lie pretty much whenever he opens his big mouth, and one wonders if he himself is unable to tell fact from fiction anymore. A shame really. A huge liability as well, as the citizenry is at a loss to tell what is believable...or not, dangerous to no measure, as it confuses reality with made-for-TV soap opera,  and renders people useless, unable to think and decide for themselves. Trump's incompetence in most things is dwarfed by his tremendous ability to praise himself and take credit for anything worth mentioning...while finding culprits and scapegoats to distract us from his daily wicked behavior, either by his racist remarks or abusing women's condition and certainly by condemning a free press just doing what they do best, inform us based on the evidence. To compound Trump's stupidity, he relies exclusively on Fox Noise,  his official propaganda outlet, totally biased, and ready to spread conspiracy theories 'a la Hannity', repulsive as it is, fake journalists Machiavelli would be proud of, using sneaky means to their nefarious end, misinform. Meanwhile, the republican party, sitting idle in congress, is being paid for 'dereliction of duty'."

Real estate taxes rise almost every year and are even higher in places like Long Island where there is no local income taxes to support the governments there.  The union contract for our building staff is up for renew this month and they will likely want an increase.  As buildings age, more repairs are needed.  We are currently replacing our elevator machines from 1957 to meet city mandates in 2020 and 2027.  We should more in terms of at cost housing rather than affordable housing.

2856,Business,"I made a decision to not get into the Facebook craze shortly after becoming aware of Zuckerberg and his modus operandi. Putting all of my personal data into an open system such as FB seemed to be the most ridiculous thing I could think of doing. As time went on and I learned more about Z's personal attributes: hubris, greed, business ethics etc, I could only feel vindicated for not falling into this trap. <br/><br/>I believe that the FB business needs to be brought under control through federal regulation much like other media have been regulated (up until recent past). I'd like to see Z. fined for the cavalier ways in which he has dealt with the data entrusted to him by the billions of people who bought into his mega-business scam (much like Trump had to pay for his ""University"" scam)."
2857,Business,So Facebook should set aside $1000 per person as a compensation.<br/><br/>That'll be about (does the math) $87 billiion dollars.<br/><br/>Then we decide whether to leave Facebook solvent after paying that.
2858,Business,"But hey, the dude who started facebook so guys can rate girls while hacking into Harvard's face books is wearing a suit! Everything's gonna be alright! In the meantime, share away!

2859,Business,"The new number -- 87 million --  makes me think Facebook knew all along the breach was bigger. To me, it looks like they were trying to spin this away, but now are afraid of a leak, so they are coming clean. Speculation, I know, but that's what happens when a company brakes your trust. In order to earn back trust, they now need to be hyper transparent about everything. Or, they could calculate their market share is so dominant, they may go back to business as usual. But, Many past avid FB users have now gone quiet. FB cannot afford to lose their content providers. My message: err on the side of ridiculous transparency from no on -- so your content providers feel confident sharing their stuff.  "
2860,Business,"Given this information and what we now know about how our personal information is being used, we should be much more concerned about Trump/Mulvaney's efforts to gut the Bureau of Consumer Protection.

Thatâs what we got when the Soviet Union collapsed.<br/><br/>Reagan &amp; Bush put that in place, instead of the investment and partnership, a Marshall Plan, that they needed.

Thatâs why Putin is so angry.<br/><br/>Yeltsin was forced to sign on to get needed aid. Plus he was drunk much of the time and didnât know much. Now in the US we have governmentt under the thumb of the Kochs. Rule by the Kochs is like rule by Putin.<br/><br/>Laissez-faire and lack of security on the Internet is what allowed tyrants, Steve Bannon and Cambridge Analytica, to steal our data. That gave power to their propaganda, which they used to steal our election. They are tyrants because they helped put a tyrant in power.<br/><br/>Putin does the same to subvert many western democracies. But donât blame Putin.

People moving there from smaller metro areas think that those prices are outrageous. Actually many who live there do not commute to Philadelphia. They live, work and shop in the ring of suburban areas that ring Philadelphia. To avail oneself of such prices, one needs to consider the ""developments"" consisting of perhaps two or three house deslgns that were built in the 1960s.

Some people are acidic due to chronic metabolic syndrome. They can't function methylation pathway well. I have been reinforcing methylation pathway by diet and practicing ""C Cleanse"" using buffered and reduced  vitamin C daily over 2 years based upon the advice from Dr. Russell Jaffe. Methylation pathway or c cleanse is not powerful in comparison with other chelation methods, but I don't suffer from heavy metal contamination if I check with the table in the last page of the book ""The Toxin Solution"" written by Dr. Joseph Pizzorno, another expert on heavy metal detoxification.

The Eighth Avenue corridor now Frederick Douglass Blvd. was a desolate strip dotted with vacant store fronts, gutted tenements above. At night a No Manâs Land, few were willing to walk.<br/><br/>A retired merchant seaman in my building moved there in 1939. He tried never to be coming or going in the streets past nightfall. Youth gangs preyed upon the elderly like him, often waiting at the subway station for exiting targets.<br/><br/>The upside: a short commute to midtown, year round breathtaking views of seasons changing that plays out dramatically in my windows. Parking used to be easy though one drawback were the break-ins.<br/><br/>It took nearly 25 years for me to see any substantial change in the area. And right now itâs accelerating.

2907,Arts&Leisure,"I guess if it's important to you to refer to everyone who has had cancer as a ""cancer victim,"" you . . . can? Under the apparent theory that if a terrible thing happens and one survives it, one should still be forever classified as a victim (which seems pretty clearly where you're going with this . . . that the term ""rape victim"" was good enough for our grandaddies, why must we stop using it?).<br/><br/>Next up, snippy comments regarding such commonly found locutions as:<br/><br/>""He survived a childhood of abject poverty and eventually became a great success."" (Let's go with, ""A victim of abject poverty, he . . .""<br/><br/>And of course, Gloria Gaynor's anthem needs to be recast. After all, how many women actually perish as the result of a breakup?

I, however, like ""Passion for Peaches"" below, did not watch the series because of the rape scene and general objectification of women it seemed so totally focused on. I do get tired of watching women get victimized  on tv...I'm glad Ms. Wood was empowered by her portrayal, though, and I applaud her willingness to share her experiences with Congress and the world.

2909,Arts&Leisure,Thereâs nothing wrong with nudity per se: it becomes exploitive when itâs used as a âticked-boxâ element in a film.

So does not move the plot. The camera lingers too long. There might even be a slo-mo element. And you know that  scene is there solely because there is a list of titillations that must appear on screen. Tick the boxes. Itâs practically a trope.

There are have been numerous studies documenting these problems and more.<br/>The evidence that climate change has already negatively impacted many species is quite extensive.<br/>For those who think that adaptation can occur, you need to realize that first these changes are happening very quickly, and adaptation is not instantaneous.<br/>Second, and more importantly in order for adaptation to climate change to occur within a species. there must exist natural variation for a trait that provides fitness in this changing environment. Many species will lack the necessary variation.<br/>Third, in cases of co-evolution- bird and plant, bee and plant, there must be variation for co-adaptive traits in both species. "
2919,Science,I think there needs to be some investigation into what effect that tilt of the earth's axis is having on climate change.

I'm tempted, but I'm also sure that the vast majority of middle class (including 'upper middle') &amp; poorer kids still manage to grow up and launch without all this psychological help, hand-holding, and expensive re-assuring. <br/><br/>I'm all for therapy for kids with real illnesses, but this sounds like re-enforcing the neediness of the worried well. In many of these cases it is likely that the parents could use the therapy themselves to learn to be realistic about the fact that it's ok for kids to fail sometimes, that not every kid can or should ace the ACT, and that 'success' in life is not only measured in grades and dollars.

2934,Learning,"Teaching is the most underrated job in the United States, if not, the world. Teachers spend long days on their feet, educating the minds of future generations. They do not get to go home and relax after work like other jobs. They instead spend late nights generating lesson plans and grading hundreds of assignments. You would think that with such an important job, teachers would receive a high salary. But unfortunately, that is not the case. <br/><br/>On April 2, thousands of teachers walked out of schools in protest of budget cuts for education and low pay. Although law makers offered a $6,000 raise to teachers with experience, teachers demand more. Many teachers in Oklahoma have to work two or three jobs because they canât sustain themselves with just teaching. Oklahoma is not the only state to protest the government's negligence toward education. Teachers striked in West Virginia last month and teachers in Arizona may follow soon due to the stateâs continuous efforts to slash education funding. <br/><br/>Iâm proud of these teachers for striking. It takes a lot of courage to risk everything in order to stand up for what is right. I hope the strikes in Oklahoma and West Virginia will send a message to law makers everywhere and encourage them to finally increase teacher pay funding for education. "
2935,Learning,"I think that teachers should get paid more because us as students are the future and without us being the future not a single teacher will get paid . Without teachers there is no education and there will not be a way for you to get a job . I  think teachers do have the right to get paid more because there the reason many people have jobs . The type off work people do , they can look back and remember that they learn this during their  time in school . "

Exploit natural gas, ship it liquefied as LNG and China, India, and soon, Africa, can have cheap clean electricity.  <br/><br/>The 2 US LNG import terminals have been converted to export with 5 under construction - ships capable of moving LNG increased by 50% just last year.<br/><br/>LNG will save the planet from global warming and pollution.

Their utility is close to zero so there really is no comparison to other products for which utility is huge compared to the few accidental deaths they may cause and are constantly being made safer through technology. The only utility of guns is the false claim that they are useful for defense but this is both statistically wrong and factually false. Guns are seldom successful instruments of defense, kill more victims through accidents, and have negative utility when the numbers are truly examined instead of occasional anecdotes.<br/><br/>Nice try even though you are arguing for gun control. But because we don't need guns at all, and their utility is negative, the only rational argument is that they all should be banned. We actually can reach a point where there are no guns so that even the police can abandon them, and the argument for their use as defenses will be an empty one."

I will try your version with red wine to compare the 2. "
2974,Dining,"I love making beef stew in a slow cooker, but I have a few questions about this recipe which I hope Julia Moskin can answer. Why use chicken stock instead of beef stock? Why discard the beef fat and then render fat from expensive pancetta? Just saute the veggies in a modest amount of beef fat.  Any why discard the cooked celery when it is perfectly tasty? That's not very frugal. I also don't think marinating the meat is really necessary and would be interested to know whether anyone has done blind tastings comparing non-marinated beef stew with marinated. Tip: I use a sun-dried tomato instead of tomato paste, so I don't have to open a whole can of the latter, which inevitably goes to waste. Also, I have a GE gas stove from Sears with a small back burner that is perfect for simmering when set to the lowest setting. I'm not sure why a professional like Julia does not have a better stove than what a frugal home cook like me has. "
2975,Dining,"I've been making beef stew for 50 years, and everyone loves it.  The best beef stew I've ever made was done in the Instant Pot.  35 minutes under pressure instead of hours in the oven, and the results were better."
2976,Dining,"No matter what I do, traditionally, the meat DRIES OUT! Now I've learned to cook the meat in a pressure cooker and everything else on the stove and combine at the end. Heresy? Non."
2977,Dining,Nothing better than a Carbonnade Belgian beef stew made with beer.
2978,Dining,"As I got older [I am seventy-six], I found that making beef stew with white wine resulted in a good deal of tenderness and flavor but without the excessive richness which,  increasingly, I found affected my gastrointestinal well-being."
2979,Dining,"Iâve been modifying Thomas Kellerâs braised short rib recipe ever since I saw it in the mid 90s in Food &amp; Wine. The version in the French Laundry cookbook is the benchmark but time consuming. I think bone in short ribs work best for a stew; the bone gives it a depth of flavor chuck cannot match.  Straining the marinade vegetables out of the stew, removing some fat then reducing the broth and whisking in some Dijon really refine the dish. Topping the short rib w a remoulade of parsley, bread crumbs, garlic, olive oil and lemon peel brightens the dish and gives it texture. "
2980,Dining,"I like to use bacon fat, saved from breakfast, to sautÃ© my trinity, imparts a wonderful flavor.Never use tomatoes in any form and find that about  one cup of wine is sufficient. Rub the meat with crushed garlic and bring meat to room temperature, about half an hour before browning.  Finish off in the oven at 250 for four to five hours."
2981,Dining,"I think the stew is better off in a pot with the lid ajar.  As Harold McGee wrote in the NYT a tightly sealed pot will come to a boil ( <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/02/dining/02curi.html"" title=""https://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/02/dining/02curi.html"" target=""_blank"">https://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/02/dining/02curi.html</a> )  The problem with boiling the stew is that it emulsifies that fat into the sauce, leaving it greasy.  Leaving the lid ajar provides just enough evaporation to prevent boiling and also allows the liquid to slowly reduce; I find the total liquid in the stew stays about the same as the cooking meat releases juices."
2982,Dining,"I live in an RV, full-time, and have to put up with a small kitchen. I have an Instant Pot Ultra and much prefer it to my Le Creuset French oven for most tasks. The IP lets me set a temperature and it will hold it within a degree or two forever. I can sautÃ© the meat using one mode, then pressure-cook the meat to melt the collagens, then add the potatoes/onions/carrots. After all that, I can still raise the heat to reduce the sauce to the desired consistency - all in one pot. <br/><br/>I like Kenji's suggestion to add umami-enhancers like anchovies, Asian fish sauce, soy sauce, tomato paste or Worcestershire sauce to the mix. These additions really amp-up the meatiness of the dish. Why eschew modern methods when they improve on the classical approaches? I dearly love Julia's boeuf bourguignon recipe, but it works well in an electric pressure cooker, too. <br/><br/>I would like to see more recipes in the NYT that employ the modern multi-cookers. I use Melissa's book regularly, as well as ""The Food Lab"" from J. Kenji Lopez-Alt and his contributions via SeriousEats.com. It's the way of the future."
2983,Dining,"Dear Julia, step away from gas burning stove tops and get an induction cook top, cooking at a bare simmer is easy and you can ""stomp"" away.

2984,Dining,"Not a fan of pancetta in beef stew.  I would omit that ingredient b/c it corrupts, IMO the pure flavor of the beef."
2985,Dining,Add some decent balsamic vinegar for a bit of brightness.
2986,Dining,One could make the case that the best part of beef stew are the potatoes. They definitely arenât there to thicken the sauce. They should be added for the last 45 minutes of cooking and they take on all the  flavors of the stew. 
2987,Dining,"I start a stew in the morning before heading to work.  Sometimes I'll take the time to sear the beef and sweat the aromatics, sometimes not.  The wine (or sometimes beer) that goes in the pot has to be something I'd drink straight up -- no plonk or swill.  But ultimately I set the oven at 250 degrees before heading out the door to work.  8 to 10 hours later, I've got a great stew just ready for a hit of seasoning and acid before serving with some crusty bread.  Can't be beat."
2988,Dining,"After decades of cooking stew for hours at low heat, I'll never cook it again except in an Instant Pot.  Just sayin...<br/>One comment about cooking in a dutch oven: cover the pot with parchment paper before putting the lid on."
2989,Dining,"Because it's already been done. See Lobio from Melissa Clark.<br/>Besides, the job of a food writer isn't to ""promote"" or ""endorse"" a particular life style, it's to explore as many facets of cuisine as people are interested in. "

2995,Dining,"Slow cookers manufactured in the past 25 years or so are far, far hotter than the originals of the '70s and '80s.  Alas, they are gauged to BOIL their contents -- which turns ANY beef cut into shoe leather.  Even cuts that used to be thrifty (short ribs, flank steak, etc) are these days expensive treats for most families or seniors.  Take it from our sad, repeated experience:  AVOID using a slow cooker for beef stew or any meat dish!"
2996,Dining,"@ SacNative.<br/><br/>This has not been my experience in testing dozens of cookers one the years.<br/><br/>On nearly all of the common brands the low setting heats to about 140 degrees and the high setting to about 170. I have never seen one boil. But if you have a machine with a defective thermostat you can regulate this by slightly separating the pot from the heat source. This kind of tweak is a part of why I enjoy cooking. As I said, it's just a heat source and a ceramic pot.<br/><br/>As for turning beef into shoe leather, I guess we don't wear the same kind of shoes. Grilling a cut of meat too long may do this, but boiling a cut of meat will eventually turn it into mush. <br/><br/>@Tom: As for  'keeping the steam in' try to find one with a removable lid. It works just like on a regular pot: you take the lid off and the liquids evaporate and reduce."

2999,BookReview,"Excluding extreme and uncommon states (e.g. psychosis, mania and very severe depression), and speaking about the vast majority of people, I estimate that 90-95% of psychiatric medications are unnecessary and unhelpful. They're prescribed despite the fact that they don't usually help, or do so very temporarily, sometimes at significant cost to the person's health. How is this possible?<br/><br/>A culture of biological reductionism. Illness mongering by Pharma and organized psychiatry. Widespread false beliefs about the cause of suffering (""chemical imbalance"") and what helps (pills to fix the mythical imbalance). The insurance industry, with its coding and billing, which forces distress into boxes. All the forces that dehumanized the physician patient encounter and stripped it of depth and meaning. The industrialization of medicine. <br/><br/>About 5-10% of psychotropics are helpful, in that they relieve symptoms significantly with minimal side effects, and help people get on with their lives.<br/><br/>Talking, walking, wellness measures and making life changes are by far more helpful to most. Also, there's usually no complete cure for most things, because we're talking about life itself. <br/><br/>Brainwashing of the public, though, is complete. Any time I ramble on to anyone about the above, whether to doctors or lay people, they'll stare at me, and after a pause ask: ""But you DO prescribe medications""? <br/><br/>Because that's all a psychiatrist is good for, it seems. So it goes."
3000,BookReview,"Based on the account the reviewer provides, Slater offers a keen take on American psychiatry.  This is a âThe empower  has no clothesâ moment.  We (Iâm an American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology certified  MD with 35 years of experience treating patients) accepted the now  discredited.SSRI hypothesis as a natural fact... because it came from the mouths of scientists (who are holier than those of us in the clinical communit) and appeared to rest on their double-blind research results.  It was a matter of faith.<br/><br/>Plus, it appeared to offer the heady  power to help people with whom, hitherto,<br/> weâd been rather helpless.  And itâs added the sheen of science to psychiatry.  And letâs not forget the cash machine.<br/><br/>Donât get me wrong.  Iâve seen antidepressants provide positive outcomes, some even of  long-term duration.  But the more common pictures include botched results, complications, accommodation to clinical effects, trial and error prescribing that goes on forever, and further less-than-optimal outcomes.<br/><br/>I am certain that scientific progress will reveal our current neurotransmitter hypotheses about mental illness to be wildly over-simplified."
3001,BookReview,"Excellent article summarizing, through Lauren Slater's story, of the hardships of people struggling to deal with disabling psychological issues. <br/><br/>The last century will be known for our fascination with chemicals in every aspect of our lives. Chemicals have been both a boon and a curse.<br/><br/>Diagnosis and treatment of mental disturbances is still an imperfect art. There are many other aspects of treatment yet to explore. <br/><br/>Hopefully, there will be more research and data of other therapies applied, a list of which is too long to elaborate here. This list is full of creativity in how, where, and what kind of therapies can be used, responsibly."
3002,BookReview,"Lithium destroyed my kidneys.  Iâm on dialysis and need a kidney transplant now.  The antipsychotic aripiprazole has been a miracle drug for me, completely taking away my suicidality and auditory hallucinations, and considerably evening out my depression and mania.  I only take it and lamotrigine, a mood stabilizer, now, plus some other drugs for high blood pressure and the effects of end stage renal failure.

I canât find a lawyer whoâs willing to bring a class action suit against the drug companies for the destructive effects of lithium.<br/>And yet I would never go off my medication.

Thank you.  <a href=""https://kennedysandking.com/martin-luther-king-articles/the-martin-luther-king-conspiracy-exposed-in-memphis"" title=""https://kennedysandking.com/martin-luther-king-articles/the-martin-luther-king-conspiracy-exposed-in-memphis"" target=""_blank"">https://kennedysandking.com/martin-luther-king-articles/the-martin-luthe...</a><br/><br/>Carole Ferraro 4-6-2018"
3009,Insider,"David Margolick, so if we want to find Stokely Carmichael's reaction to Dr. King's death we should enter, ""inflammatory remarks about guns""?"
3010,Insider,I appreciate your including this in the MLK stories on this sad anniversary.  It brings another time vividly to life.
3011,Insider,"Back in the day, I looked forward to reading the Daily News when they had the best columnists - my favorites Earl Caldwell &amp; Jimmy Breslin, et al. Great reads."
3012,Insider,Gripping and harrowing reporting. I'm stricken by the shock and the disturbing feeling that even today the official explanation(s) of what happened and who shot Dr. King just don't make sense.
3013,Insider,"Did it occur to the author to use the word ""staff"" instead of ""men""?  Yes, I realize most of the reporters were men and there was plenty of sexism, but if I wrote such a piece today I would use a gender neutral term."
3014,Insider,"Not much in this article on the journalistic reason Mr. Caldwell was sent down there.<br/>According to him, the editor sent Mr. Caldwell down there to do a âjournalistic hit jobâ on Dr. King."
3015,Insider,"The paper of history covering it as it unfolded. <br/><br/>Lead type, cigarette smoke, rotten coffee and adrenaline. "
3016,Insider,I recently read Jim Douglas's account of the civil trial for the murder of Rev. King.  I was astonished at all the evidence there is that point to a conspiracy to murder Rev. King that reached into Federal agencies.  One of the readers commented on how the bushes and grass had been cut down....any other tampering with the crime scene?  We have yet to be told the truth!
3017,Insider,"He wasn't the ""lone journalist,"" thank you very much.  Have you not seen Joseph Louw's famous photo of the assassination, showing King down on the balcony surrounded by his entourage?  Do you not consider Barney Sellers of the Commercial Appeal, to be a journalist?  You ran his photo along with your story.  To think that in this day and age the New York Times doesn't consider photojournalists to be journalists is astounding.  <a href=""http://time.com/3749091/mlk-assassination-photograph/"" title=""http://time.com/3749091/mlk-assassination-photograph/"" target=""_blank"">http://time.com/3749091/mlk-assassination-photograph/</a>"
3018,Insider,"I was 15 years old and living in Cincinnati, Oho.  I remember feeling lost the same feeling I had when President Kennedy was killed.  Why did this happen?  As a young Blackman my parents  would not let us go outside because of the riots.  Here we are 50 years later with no strong black leader.  It is so sad that the person in the white house who plays president has not made mention on this date.  In a way I am glad he has not because I do not think he would say anything respectful.  Thank you Dr. King for provide a path for me to follow!"
3019,Insider,It would have been nice to see an image of the day-after front page.
3020,Insider,"Thank you for this first-hand account of events and a glimpse into journalism in an earlier age.<br/>For the past few days I've been steeped in reading and watching documentaries about Dr. King. It all brings me to tears, still.<br/>And 50 years on, we appear to be moving backward, not forward."
3021,Insider,"A truly amazing article. I could feel the tension. It reads like a screenplay for a frenetic movie. It reminds me of ""All The Presidents Men""<br/>Also interesting is remembering what it was like before cell phones, Internet, email etc. I could picture the composing room with the pre-set obit waiting to go to the composing stone for final updates. The industrial sounds of the Linotype machines casting hot lead. No computers there.<br/>Make a movie!"
3022,Insider,"The same NYT journalist Earl Caldwell writes in today's (April 4) NY Daily News, ""Questions Linger"" with a somewhat different take. <br/><br/>""The official story came the night of the assassination with a stamp of 'case closed.' The killer was James Earl Ray, an escaped convict, officials said.<br/>Ray fired the shot from the bathroom window of a flophouse a block away. A manhunt was already in the works.<br/>Two days later, I stood in my motel room doorway and noticed the crime scene had been altered.<br/>Across from the motel, the thicket of trees, brush and big weeds all had been cut to within an inch of the ground."""
3023,Insider,"This story very much reminded me of the photographer Joe Louw, a brilliant young colored South African I knew in Dar es Salaam, Tanganyika (now Tanzania) when I was teaching in Africa for a year in 1962-1963.  His name appears as the byline under your photograph of  King lying on the balcony, surrounded by officers with NYT's Caldwell in the background.  Joe was trying to get to the United States after fleeing S.A. with his white girlfriend.  He and I lost track of each other when we both left Tanganyika after the spring of 1963, so five years later I was startled to see his name and face in Life Magazine the week after the assassination, as the photographer who was photographing King on the balcony when the murder occurred.  Life ran his spectacular pictures the week after the event, folks around King, some pointing towards the point from which the shots came.  I tried to contact Joe, dropping a note c/o Life shortly afterwards, but was never able to make contact, and do not know what became of him later.  (I was a graduate student -- in physics -- at the time, so I did not have time to follow up, alas.  <br/><br/>I hope Joe went on with this wonderful scoop to have a rich career as a journalistic photographer, which I thought he well deserved.  He had come to the school for refugees where I taught in Dar that year with three other American student volunteers.  That was a rich and vividly remembered time for us all, with earth-shaking events striking near and far."
3024,Insider,"Interesting to think of how the NY Times itself was so segregated and discriminatory throughout the 1960s that the Paper didn't even have Black reporters available to cover the civil rights movement, much less other news events and stories. It was actually a novel idea for the Times to send a Black reporter to cover King in Memphis.<br/><br/>This, for a large paper located in NYC, which had large African American population, much of which was well-educated. "
3025,Insider,Thank you Free Press. Because of you we all remember. 
3026,Insider,"You can listen to the clip of him speaking on the History Channel:  <a href=""https://www.history.com/embed/21170832"" title=""https://www.history.com/embed/21170832"" target=""_blank"">https://www.history.com/embed/21170832</a>"
3027,Insider,"I suppose some of today's readers might even object to this:<br/>""...Diane Henry, news assistant, manned the telephones as the men called in.""<br/><br/>But to be realistic, the title of 'rewrite man' had been part of the newsroom vocabulary for decades. The rewrite desk was a known as place for fast, accurate and highly skilled writers, male or female. I doubt the women working the desk in 1968 would have felt diminished by the imperfect job title. In that era, if the term ""rewrite men"" was altered at all for gender accuracy, these journalists would likely have ended up being called 'rewrite girls'-- not exactly an improvement.<br/>Gender roles--happily--sometimes change very suddenly; language, not so much. Our vocabulary occasionally must play catch up to keep pace with the pioneers who break through gender barriers. But that's OK. Somebody has to take the lead, and these women are more than capable of the task."
3028,Insider,"Actually, you can rewrite history.  And the rewrite women would be just the ones to do it. <br/><br/>There's no excuse for this sentence in the 21st century:<br/>""Maggie Hunter and Eileen Shanahan pitched in as rewrite men.""<br/><br/>It's absurd, and comes across as laughable.<br/>If you want to use the term for its historicity, write it that way.  E.g. Maggie Hunter and Eileen Shanahan contributed in a role that was known at the time as ""rewrite men.""  <br/><br/>How hard was that?<br/>Come on Gray Lady, you're sounding so last millennium.  Pick up your game. "
3029,Insider,"Ms. Weninger: The writer was trying to capture the reality of the situation as it was. He was surrounded by men. His phone contacts were men, etc. This isn't a criticism of Mr. Margolick as that was the way it was. These journalists were doing their jobs without a second thought regarding the female point of view. Just think how far we've come. Though it took quite a long time, I'm certain that Dr. King would have felt that his ideals and work accomplished a great deal during the inauguration of President Obama. "
3030,Insider,No concrete evidence of a conspiracy whatsoever but don't let that stop you.
3031,Insider,"Yes, Mugs, but the idea that they first got it started when MLK was all of 31 years old IS remarkable..."
3032,Insider,Too bad that they are now often hard pressed to do the same.
3033,Insider,This is the comment I was going to make.  Everything was mechanical or over limited phone lines.  The reporter had to fish for change to call his story in.  Pre-written obits or stories were actually stored in Linotype set lead type.  Little or no computer typesettingin 1968 and of course no internet communication...fax machines took 8 minutes or so per page.  Very exciting article.
3034,Insider,Chilling.
3035,Insider,He's living in North Carolina.  Glad that my ancestors left that state before the Civil War.
3036,Insider,"Now, now.  That's a biased statement."
3037,National,"It should be required viewing that all US citizens watch Michael Moore's ""Where to Invade Next"" - he shows how various countries (mostly in Europe - broadly defined) provide forl with social needs differently (&amp; much more humanely) than in the US...School lunches, workplace policies, drug laws, etc., etc are covered INCLUDING a segment on Prisons in Norway.  They are truly institutions for rehabilitation.  This is what is needed here, though maybe then people would realize that providing quality education and health care for all as well as true living wages would mediate against high imprisonment in the first instance...Note how high MI's hideous prison budget is! It is the ugly spirit of judgment that seems to prevent empathy and understanding, helpful ways to help one another."
3038,National,"Nearly every week brings some new Trumpian anxiety-producing concept. This week, for me, it's privatization. Obama sought to phase out the use of private contractors to run Federal prisons, but Jeff Sessions reversed that. Shulkin claims he was fired because he resisted Trump's plans to privatize many of the Veterans Administration's functions. Betsy DeVos wants to privatize Education, shifting funds from Public Schools to charter schools and religious schools. There has even been privatization talk when infrastructure is discussed, as in private ownerships of roads and bridges. <br/><br/>These four areas - prisons, Veterans' services, education and infrastructure - are very expensive. Tempting as it is to certain politicians to sell off these functions to the highest bidder, it is ludicrous to think that there is enough money in these endeavors to run them successfully with well-trained, effective and skilled employees, excellent care and service for the veterans, academic progress and social/emotional support for the students, safety and the possibility of rehabilitation for the incarcerated, etc., while skimming off profits for shareholders. <br/><br/>Only those of a mindset that worships the corporate/profit ethos over the shared civic ethos of American society sees potential profit when looking at these endeavors. The rest of us think any spare dollars floating around at the end of the quarter should be plowed back into decrepit school buildings, V.A. Hospitals and prisons."
3039,National,Timothy Williams has shown that journalism and the First Amendment are powerful tools to bring social issues to the minds of America. The issue of real meaningful justice in America is a lingering sore upon society that might not ever be resolved.<br/>Thanks for the true story. 
3040,National,"Prisons and jails are breeding grounds for more crime and must be limited to only those who have demonstrated a lack of remorse for violent offenses. Like sex offender registries, nothing good is achieved and we remain blind to the fact that prisons and registries are a harm to society. Remember this the next time your local politician claims to be tough on crime. Tough, yes... but not smart.<br/><br/>Beware the politician who knows better not the one who has been stripped of dignity and resources to survive."
3041,National,Prisons should not be privatized. Period. Prisons are challenging enough to run without being worried about making a buck for shareholders. Most prisoners get released at some point. It's in everyone's best interest that prisoners are treated well and given opportunities for growth and change.
3042,Washington,"When Mr. Trump doesn't get his way (in this case, his wall) he reacts like a brute.  "
3043,Washington,Wake up America.  Modern Japanese history of the Showa period should serve as a warning.  When the army becomes involved in domestic matters a nation has taken a very giant step toward a totalitarian state.  
3044,Washington,Fascism on the rise in the US.
3045,Washington,"There are only two reasons for Trump's latest Tweet-burst.<br/>1) He simply can't control his impulses and stream of consciousness speaking.<br/>2) Far more importantly, and with the tacit approval of MANY Republican enablers, he is pushing the button he knows all too well... rallying the separatist elements in his base as the midterm election campaigns heat up. He knows that if Democrats gain control of the House or Senate, or simply make further gains at state levels, he will be constrained in ways that frustrate his autocratic mentality.  He actually doesn't care one whit about Mexicans crossing the border, as evidenced by his lack of wall action to date. Red herring.  Illegal border crossings are at a historic low."
3046,Washington,Isn't that what the military is supposed to do?
3047,Washington,"""not immediately clear what Mr. Trump meant by the remarks, or what the rationale would be for deploying United States troops to patrol or even seal the border.""<br/><br/>From the ivory tower nothing much is clear."
3048,Washington,"With our forces on a wild goose chase down South, the time is ripe for Canada. Invade us. Please!!!!"
3049,Washington,"It becomes harder and harder to believe this man was elected President of the United States, and it is very dispiriting to read about what he is doing.  Trump has no respect for the United States as a country of laws and tradition, and each day he wings it with one vituperative tweet after another.  Where this stops is impossible to know, but the way things are headed we can be somewhat assured that it will not be in a good place.  Therefore, it is absolutely paramount that Democrats retake the House to put some breaks on what Trump is doing to our nation.  In the meantime, it would be most helpful if some Republican leaders exercised influence and restraint over their President."
3050,Washington,Pity he can't be the first President to protect us from AR-15 toting white guys.  More people have been killed by guns WITHIN our borders than by illegal immigrants.
3051,Washington,OMG.  Another paranoid bigot.  This is exactly why sane people don't want people like you to put people like them at the point of a gun.  Are we facing imminent takeover?
3052,Learning,"I participated in March Madness this year by creating a bracket and joining pools. I had Villanova winning it all and they did not disappoint. My bracket was going strong for the first couple of games but right as Virginia lost I knew something was up. The first time in March Madness history, a sixteenth seed (UMBC) beat a one seed (Virginia). I wasnât to upset even though I had Virginia in the national championship. But it was because one of the pools I participated in more than half of the people chose Virginia to win it all so it actually made me happy. After that game my bracket started to fall apart with UNC and Arizona losing but it didnât matter because I had faith in Villanova and they proved me right. <br/><br/>	The game started off sloppy for Villanova with them trailing most of the first half to the Michigan Wolverines. They worked their offense around their big man, Moritz Wagner, and it worked. I was scared that if Michigan played like this the whole time Villanova would lose the championship and not win for the second time in three years. Thankfully, I was wrong. Donte DiVincenzo came off Novaâs bench as their go to sixth man and he did not disappoint. He gave Nova a comeback to give them a 9 point lead at the end of the first half. After half time, you new the game was over. Villanova came out strong in the second half getting blocks, steals, dunks, and a lot of threeâs. Ultimately Villanova was the better team going into this and they payed like it the entire time. "
3053,Well,"""Studies of [x] may have led researchers astray."" Fill in the blank as you wish. Ten years from now, studies will doubtless reaffirm the importance of x, only for it to be discounted in 20 years.<br/><br/>I think of medical professionals of all sorts as ""trendoid."" They are extremely conventional people, and they follow whatever comes down the pike.<br/><br/>My grandmother was not the least bit trendoid, but she strongly believed in vitamins and herbs. She was old by the time I was born, and I'm old now, so she came of age when rural people had to find their own solutions to health problems. She believed strongly in supplements but didn't much believe in food, and she was thin as a rail. She was convinced that she could tell what she needed and didn't. I once gave her some B12 vitamins, hoping they would enhance her appetite, and she returned them to me in a few days, saying they had given her an appetite. I never underestimated her after that.<br/><br/>Anyway, she was so healthy that the federal government once sent someone to check on her because she received Social Security but had never used her Medicare.<br/><br/>I lived away from home, but when I visited, I very quickly tired of the food wars. My grandmother should eat more, my mother and her brothers thought. They tried everything short of outright threats to get her to eat.<br/><br/>Granny lived as she wanted. She died peacefully at age 101. And my mother's response? ""How long might she have lived had she not just eaten right?!""<br/><br/>Right."
3054,Well,"The lack of understanding apparent in many of these comments about scientific method, clinical trials and their limits is the scariest thing about the article. At the end of the day, docs need to remember ""primum non nocere"" and the public needs to consider spending more money on being happy, and less on supplements."
3055,Well,"There are many issues with this reporting that aid to the confusion of patients and should be corrected. First, although Ms. Bentley from Austin gave a multitude of reasons for her vitamin supplementation, they are incorrect. A multivitamin does not prevent dry eye disease (see below) and red rice yeast is used as an alternative to statins to lower cholesterol, not prevent diabetes. <br/><br/>There are a multitude of studies which demonstrate the benefit of Omega-3 fatty acids in dry eye disease, but the quote from Dr. Nissen implies there are no benefits to omega-3 supplementation at all (<a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25193932)"" title=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25193932)"" target=""_blank"">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25193932)</a><br/><br/>Finally, beta-carotene was shown to increase lung cancer rates IN SMOKERS, not the general population (<a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20155614)"" title=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20155614)"" target=""_blank"">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20155614)</a><br/><br/>Certainly there are lots of conflicting reports about vitamin supplementation but there are a multitude of inaccuracies in this reporting that are misleading. In the end, each person needs to decide for themselves what to put in their own bodies. However, data should be presented accurately and this article only adds to the confusion"
3056,Well,1)   Buy grains like hard red wheat berries and einkorn.<br/>2)   Buy a wheat grinder.<br/>3)  Make your own bread.<br/><br/>The above steps allow us to make a food that has ALL the required vitamins we need.  
3057,Well,"I am 81, in good health, meaning I can do everything I did when age 60 including biking, kayaking, and hiking up mountains.  I have been taking several supplements for the past 30 years or more.  What I know with certainty is that 200 mg of Magnesium Oxide (a Costco item) once a day stopped my history of kidney stones some 20 years ago. And, more recently when my blood pressure increased to 140 over 90, and a cardiologist told me to take blood pressure medication with a history of various side effects, I did a literature search, and switched to 200 mg of Magnesium Citrate twice a day and my BP dropped to 120/80.<br/><br/>So who's right here?  I have two children who are doctors.  They have taken one course in nutrition and none about supplements.  I am the one who educates them because their training and bias rests with the pharmaceutical industry.  Let's face it, no one knows the full story of supplements at this point because a double blind sudy of every supplement, vitamin, or herb has not been been conducted by NIH. <br/><br/>In the meantime, my experience has taught me that a plant based diet or the Mediterranean Diet with at least 30 minutes daily exercise and six glasses of water a day provide a foundation for living to 100. Read the comments by Drs. Linus Pauling and Andrew Weil as a good place to start learning about supplements.  And, lastly, the Blue Zones, for people who actually do live active lives to 100.  And, it would be wise for most American medical doctors to do the same."
3058,Well,"Thankfully I am not one of those âolderâ Americans hooked on vitamin supplements. Iâve managed to get through nearly three quarters of a century eating what is considered a typical âMediterranean dietâ most of my life, but thatâs only because I happened to have been exposed to that diet at a young age. Yes, Iâve consumed a lot of junk food over the years, but still tried to maintain a good diet when possible, which was difficult in some parts of this country where it was nearly impossible to find foods prepared with olive oil and not animal fats, deep fried, not grilled or roasted. Maintaining a Mediterranean diet in those proved to be difficult as times.<br/><br/>And thankfully, after surviving stage four cancer, not one of my doctors (UW Medicine) recommended supplements, just a normal diet. The only pills I take are low dose aspirin and the occasional antacid. Acid Reflux can be a real pain."
3059,Well,"My parents are boomers. I have watched my mom dutifully take little baggies of vitamin supplements for years. I'm not sure if they help her, as she still has the classic health problems of her age-group: high blood pressure, back pain, arthritis. Compared with her sisters who smoke though, she is probably much healthier. Although I try to eat a healthy diet with the recommended ""5 a day"" servings and exercise regularly, perhaps this vitamin habit has passed on to me, as I take a multivitamin, folic acid, and lutein each day too. Similar to this article, my GP tells me vitamins are overrated and I probably get the same amount of nutrients through my breakfast cereal and regular diet, but I (and my mom) will probably keep taking them for good measure."
3060,Well,I asked my family doc about vitamins -- he told me that he saw no benefit with such. I took his advice -- no nutrients for me; just lots of exercise and mind activity to keep me going.
3061,Well,"The work on mice by Professor David Rollo of McMaster University supports supplementation for extending physical activity of mice into old age, postponing the onset of decrepitude and senescence. He fed the mice bagel bits accurately dosed with a complex supplement designed to address the 5 biological mechanisms of cell aging. Since the study also correlated to cell aging and mitochondrial activity its reasonable to assume it might also apply to human cell biology."
3062,Well,"Dr. Weil sells things - like supplements! <br/><br/>A visit to his site - which contains a so called bespoke supplement quiz is, in actuality, a poorly designed questionnaire which pushes unnecessary and potentially deleterious supplements.  <br/><br/>Yes, he stayed away from claiming his products heal real diseases - but he's still swimming in the toxic soup of snake oil sales.  "
3063,Well,"The problem with relying on doctors to prescribe supplements is that most of them are even more ignorant about nutrition than they are about, say, long-term suppression of immune function following a short course of the antibiotics they readily prescribe. As an example of this, a doctor prescribed methylated B-12 and folate to my partner because she was deficient in those nutrients and her 23andMe results indicated heterozygous MTHFR deletions that impair her methylation ability. What the doctor did not understand is that the COMT deletions found on the same report mean that she has extreme impairment of several detoxification pathways, including one responsible for reversing methylation. Even after I called the doctor to explain that the prescribed supplements had caused my partner to become manic, the doctor could not explain why that happened or what to do about it.<br/><br/>Fortunately, we figured out quite a lot on our own. Enough to put an end to recurring and severe bipolar symptoms that several doctors said were due to a chemical imbalance (true, but not a major cause of symptoms) that would require a lifetime of psychotropic drug treatment (demonstrably false). We found safe, effective OTC supplements that ended her symptoms, just as the information in neurology, microbiology, and oncology journals predicted, and contrary to the ignorant misinformation provided by psychiatrists and other M.D.'s. Until doctors know more about supplements, they should not act as gatekeepers."
3064,Well,"We have no idea how many people get harmed by mega doses of vitamins. Since some vitamins like vitamin C can act as antioxidants and pro oxidants, they might be very well responsible for some cases of cancer through oxidative damage of DNA. And as I mentioned many times before, Big Pharma IS Big Vitamin!"
3065,Well,"Amy, B-12 (crucial for brain and nervous system function) is rather plentiful in the average diet. Consequently a deficiency of the vitamin is usually caused from an inability to absorb it, just as calcium is largely dependent on a diet of leafy greens for its absorption. In B-12's case the body requires a protein called Intrinsic factor to bind on the vitamin in the gut before absorption is possible. Unfortunately as we get older our ability to create Intrinsic factor decline which, in certain cases, can lead to Pernicious Anemia, a dangerous condition which results in a feeling of overall tiredness, numbness in hands and feet, poor balance, poor reflexes, depression and confusion. In the nineteenth century, before treatment was discovered, people often died from it. Supplements, therefore, won't help if your sister isn't producing the necessary quantity of Intrinsic factor; which unfortunately seems likely given she's ""a carnivore"" (red meat being an excellent source of B-12). I'd strongly recommend she consider getting a trial run of B-12 injections for a few months and see how she responds to them. Restoring B-12 levels to a normal level makes a profound improvement to one's quality of life. As a Pernicious anemia sufferer myself I do my own injections around every four weeks or so, more often if I feel excessively tired. The vitamin is cheap, only a few dollars a vial, even in the States."
3066,Well,"PPS:  Kindly remember that pharmaceuticals are synthesized, patented versions of natural substances.<br/><br/>*Better Profits Through Chemistry*<br/><br/>Isolating one active component of complex substances often means that an active drug ingredient is not balanced by others.  White willow bark infusions don't cause the same bleeding risks as aspirin does, for example.<br/><br/>We are all responsible for our own health, and fertile people are responsible to a considerable degree for the health of potential progeny.  A daily multivitamin for all people with the potential of procreating might save them, and society, a tremendous amount of grief."
3067,Well,They do that when they donât know or they are annoyed that you questioned their knowledge. 
3068,Well,"This article is about healthy people preventing disease. <br/><br/>This comment is about treatment of the specific needs of a specific disease.<br/><br/>They are not at all the same, and the obvious invitation to confusion might hurt people who miss the distinction."
3069,Well,"The placebo effect is not limited to supplements. And if it cures you, it is an argument for faith healing as being valid!"
3070,Metro,I think they missed a spot. 
3071,Metro,Google probably knows.
3072,Metro,We'll never wash Freddie out of the Morning amusement page.<br/>C-hairy on!
3073,Metro,"Sorry, there is a difference between rooting for both  teams and rooting for one or the other when they play each other. I watched MM, RM and WF play at the Stadium and watched the Mets play in the Polo grounds under Casey. Someone fed you the one or the other stuff when you were younger, too bad."
3074,Sports,As fine and overall performance since I saw Oscar Robertson play<br/><br/>in the NCAA's.
3075,Sports,"Coach Wright has built a better mouse trap, or has now ""Moneyballed"" a new system of player development and roster management.  What Wight appears to have done is create a whole new paradigm with his ""roster management"".  Instead of recruiting kids who's only goal is to get to the NBA the very next year, Wright seems to be recruiting kids that he feels are two to three years from getting to the NBA.  This gives him roster stability from one year to the next, but also having players with both the talent and experience to handle the one and done programs.  So, he is recruiting the near very best tier of players and developing them.  It is almost like he has developed an real program where he is actually coaching and developing players.  I remember the days when Duke and Kentucky used to do this."
3076,Sports,"I've never been a sports fan until our son started working with the Villanova mens basketball team. He shoots &amp; produces for the the ""Inside Villanova"" series, so being a good mom, I started following this team a few years back.<br/>Jay Wright is an inspiring leader in the truest sense of the word. After every game, the first words out of his mouth are to give praise to the opposing team. The emphasis is always about the team, the commitment to focus,  on doing what's best for the team. Every player is valuable and valued.<br/>By the end of the season, you feel like you know these players, and its hard to say good-bye, but there will be new players stepping in and they will be welcomed by the Nova Nation.<br/>NCAA is a huge business, and it has its seedy underbelly, but when these teams play their best, its a beautiful thing to watch and to share their excitement. "
3077,Sports,"This kid stepped up and put the team on his back, great performance, good luck to this kid he deserves it."
3078,Sports,Great team from Philly!  (Where I was born and raised).<br/>Glad they run the team differently than a NBA-prep school. 
3079,Sports,If I was eight inches taller - I would have been playing in this game.

3082,Business,"Trump unilaterally imposes tariffs on China. Xi responds with a damaging tariff on California wine, the bluest anti-Trump state in the country. Maybe Xi is a Trump supporter because Trump is so easily manipulated. Why else would he do something that so benefits the Donald?"
3083,Business,"People, please wake up before it's too late! I don't like Trump or any of the EU parties on the extreme right, the intolerant right as I call them, but until lib/con politicians take the technology transfer from the west to the east seriously, we, social liberals, will have to hope Trump succeeds in his trade negotiations. Because, there's nobody else out there who's concerned enough and willing to take the short-term pain of a trade war. Sometimes a trade war is necessary, so that future generations can live in prosperity, the kind of prosperity which can only be achieved through manufacturing -- automated or not.<br/><br/>No country in history has ever become rich from farming and/or tourism.<br/>No people in history have ever become rich by serving each other cupcakes and burgers.<br/><br/>Transgenerational independence and prosperity can only benefit those who know how to manufacture technology.<br/><br/>We're in a race for our lives, for our children's lives, and those countries who every day can run a little faster than the majority of other countries, will prosper -- because prosperity doesn't come overnight, it accumulates over time. East Asia is proving this every day. Their politicians think long-term, and they always put their countries' long-term interest ahead of their companies' short-term interests. Their citizens are patriotic and loyal, willing to take the pain of a trade-war. Are we patriotic enough to think long-term?"

3086,Travel,"I have enjoyed Yuan's postings to date, including this one.  We visited Peru in 2017 for 30+ days. We visited Machu Picchu (and loved it despite having to share it with so many others) and many ""not so well-known"" sites. We considered going to Kuelap but didn't have time to add it.  We very much enjoyed touring Sipan (near Chcilayo) and we HIGHLY recommend it. <br/><br/>I was looking forward to something in this article that would tell me why I should have gone to Kuelap as well. Instead all I see is I should have endured quite a slog to stay at a fantastic Hacienda and see an impressive waterfall. Maybe I missed it?  I have reread a couple times and still all I see is a phots that must be of the ruins."
3087,Travel,"Having visited Macchu Pichu in 1969 and having the site virtually to ourselves, it was a shock this past September to witness the onslaught of visitors that necessitated visiting the ruins in a group with a guide and not being able to linger. Of course, there wasn't as much spiritual atmosphere for which to linger since the whole place was overrun with tourists. So glad I got to visit both times, but Kuelap sounds like what we encountered at MP back in the 60s."
3088,Travel,"Having been to Machu Picchu over 20 times, I visited  KuÃ©lap, Chachapoyas and the 771 meter Gocta Falls about a year ago.  It is wonderful as Jada describes and it is a ""slog"" to get to Chachapoyas, but the pace is pleasantly broken by a variety of outstanding coffee stops along the way.  But wait, there is more.  You'll feel a bit like Indiana Jones to uncover the yet-to-be-seen-by-archaeologists funerary remains right behind the Hacienda Achamaqui.  The nearby Sonche Canyon, at nearly 1000 meters deep, is a sight not to be missed.  The Peruvian people are welcoming and the food is good and cheap.<br/><br/>Steve Solosky<br/><a href=""http://www.travelingprofessor.com"" title=""www.travelingprofessor.com"" target=""_blank"">www.travelingprofessor.com</a>"
3089,Travel,"I went to KuÃ©lap in 1992 or '93. At the time, the bus journey from the coast to the river valley overlooked by the ruins took far longer than 10 hours, and as far as I know (I took a path) there was no road from the valley floor to the ruins, let alone a cable car.<br/><br/>The ruins themselves aren't as well preserved as those at Machu Picchu, but the site is impressive, and on my visit I was entirely alone. I couldn't even find anyone to sell me a snack.<br/><br/>I'm nonetheless slightly skeptical of the author's suggestion that KuÃ©lap's inhabitants were forcibly displaced as a result of a Spanish evangelization program. I suspect the city will have been abandoned mostly voluntarily. Even now, centuries later, the children of the Chachapoyas and other indigenous peoples continue to leave their highland redoubts for coastal and other metropolises en masse, and in many cases they do so of their own accord."
3090,Travel,"Wonderful place.  Was there in 1998.  The main entrance is the nearest thing to the great wall in King Kong that I've actually encountered.  Glad there are now alternative places to stay.  Flew in from Lima on Chachapoyas Airlines.  The ""airport"" was on top of a flat butte; no room for error.  The airline's single aircraft, an Antonov-24 if I remember correctly, crashed with no survivors not longer thereafter.  The drive back down to Chiclayo, through river canyons (and a sometimes washed-out road) was beautiful.  Kuelap is not Macchu Picchu, but it's stunning in its own right."
3091,Travel,"Sigh.<br/><br/>I had the WORST altitude sickness. When we landed in Cuzco, I had a bizarre experience. Almost felt high. Things looked more vibrant and colorful and I felt almost weepy, euphoric and I said I was ""connected"" to a higher plane. Which is funny because coming off a plane and landing at 11,000 feet above sea level was a self fulfilling pun of sorts.<br/><br/>By the time we descended the 1000 or so feet to our hotel one hour later, I had a splitting headache. We got mata tea. An oxygen tank. Nothing doing. I declined day over day. It was a full blown stomach flu and the worst head pressure I have ever felt. The day we went to Machu Piccu (much lower) I felt some relief but I was fairly cooked by then. We had to cut our trip short the following day because I was heading towards hospitalization.<br/><br/>My entire family was fine: I was not. Meaning, this is not a complete certainty for everyone. However, I wish I would have brought medicine. I wish I would have consulted with my doctor prior to the trip and I wish we would have not have stayed at such a high altitude (think our hotel was at 9000+).<br/><br/>One of the most beautiful places I have ever seen, but the mere mention of the words Machu or Piccu make me nauseated and dizzy.<br/><br/>But have fun......<br/><br/>Signed, <br/><br/>Debbie Downer"

3094,Travel,"With the difficulties of reaching this location, there seems to be little danger that it would soon be overrun by tourism. Please note, also, there are thousands of places around the world that are not noted in any guidebooks, or little noticed by the traveling, madding crowd, where one can go and find the peacefulness in being in a place of wild nature with breath taking views. I am currently reading a novel where the central family moves to Alaska and I've always heard it is an amazing place to visit, as long as you go at the right time. The isolated beaches on Vieques off the eastern end of the main island of Puerto Rico rival some of the beaches in Hawaii and, when last there, we had an entirely beach to ourselves. The Big Bend area of far southwest Texas has a night sky filled with ten times more stars that most people have ever seen (away from city lights).<br/><br/>My advice is to stop taking stupid selfies everywhere you go and allow the world to come and speak to your inner being. Slow down. Get quiet. Be within and without yourself and let petty concerns fly away, as they will completely for all of us someday. <br/><br/>As for selfies, no one back home wants to look at all of those photos anyway. Do you have to take a picture of yourself to prove you were there and having a good time? Really? Or is it just a matter of you can, therefore you must?"
3095,Travel,"I very much agree---trendy and ""hot"" are probably to be avoided.  I located a remote place off the coast of Baja that Google Earth had no knowledge of--a place where we almost lost our boat and our lives one stormy night 50 years ago.   I was happy to see it has not been discovered."
3096,Travel,I always thought they were trophy hunters!
3097,Travel,"I totally agree. In fact I was going to say much the same. Never heard of Kuelap, may never have an opportunity to visit, but I would like to see something of what it looks like. The headline certainly wets an appetite that the photographs totally fail to satisfy. Quite frustrating. Well there's always Google and Wikipedia"
3098,Travel,"When I read these articles, I immediately go to google maps to see exactly where the place being described is located and usually there are lots of photos there if not actual street view 360 scenes.

3099,Travel,"From the perspective of another reporter, while there is indeed a great adventure in the undertaking (note the reference), the Times also seems to have set up a test not only of endurance but sanity. How long can she last? How far can she go? When will utter madness set in trying to grab locations and report on them in only one week each? Is she falling behind schedule (yes). Clearly, 52 places around the world in one year was an inspiration  or an act of journalistic sadism. Anyone who could travel that much and still report well and with appreciation of the places she is seeing deserves a Medal of Honor or perhaps a few months of paid recuperation. "

3101,Magazine,"I have a hard time believing that the insurance company didn't know it was paying for two doses of the medicine - such repeats should be easy to flag.  But I'm also sure stranger things have happened.  Is it possible to give the doctor enough notice so he can acquire the medicine to prevent the issue in the first place (assuming same cost from either source)?  How much does insurance pay for the medicine?  Given the lack of a challenge, I would guess it's relatively cheap compared with the cost of administering it.<br/><br/>I also doubt that the doctor will bring its mistake to the attention of the insurance company.  Not because it is inherently dishonest, but because it's a lot of hassle to become worse off (i.e. refunding money not challenged).  Best probable case is that the office stops the practice in the future."

Obtain a death certificate regarding the passing of your husband.  The County should issue an official death certificate.  That original can be attached to a cease and desist or more politely, an inquiry, letter to the agent of service of process to the Insurer who is billing you.  <br/><br/>I would certify the letter.  Eventually, that letter will make its way up the chain of command with the Insurer.  There is a great deal of abuse of death certificates by fraudsters so be certain to take measures to protect your husband's social security number on the certificate.  You could ask the Record's Manager to black out the SSN or issue one without it.  <br/><br/>You might attach a copy of your marriage license to that letter.  <br/><br/>Life is so brutal.  "

In actual face to face conversations with progressive friends I highly respect,  I have found multiple of them flat out refusing to even consider answering questions of hypothetical situations which challenge and probe the boundary of liberal orthodoxy.  They are so strictly narrative compliant, that meaningful discourse and idea exchange is severely limited.  I think both ends of the political spectrum are infected with these infections of logic and epistomology, but I see them much more on the left than right.   Epistomology and logic matter!!"

How might anyone restore the cost-value balance?""<br/><br/>An entity like the National Institute for Health Care and Excellence in the UK would go a long way toward taking that burden off the individual doctor. NICE produces guidelines for treatment of many illnesses (including medicines) based on clinical evidence.  <br/><br/>The other thing that would have to happen is removing the profit motive from providing medical care. Then the doctor can focus on the most effective treatment available within the guidelines without having to worry whether the patient's insurance will cover it."
3108,Magazine,"I ma a Canadian with personal experience in out of country medical costs.<br/><br/>In 1986, I had a severe allergic reaction to mould during an exceptionally wet summer in Germany. I went to emergency in Munich and was  given an inhaler. The cost? Zero. The doctor was on salary and felt the effort to recover the cost of the inhaler was too small relative to the cost recovery. <br/><br/>Last year, I had a sebaceous cyst burst  while bicycling across Germany. A surgeon at the a Cologne hospital lanced the cyst. The cost? For labor, nothing; but I idd pay (cost) for the medications.<br/><br/>By contrast, 3 years ago, my wife experienced a sharp abdominal pain while we were in Florida. The hospital wanted a credit card imprint before admitting her. A CT-sacn was taken. The bill for less than 3 hours in the hospital? About $6,000!<br/><br/>Our out of country medical insurer advised us not to pay; but to let it negotiate with the hospital. It settled for much much less than the bill.<br/><br/>I don't need charity; but I do expect reasonable costs.<br/><br/>Thirty years ago, I initiated a Parliamentary study on how Canada could pay for our medicare with an aging population. A parallel study was conducted of American medical costs at the same time. The conclusion was that the American medical care system would always cost a minimum of 15% more than the Canadian system for the same services driven only by the extra administrative costs of a privately insured system compare to a single payer system. You broke it; you own it! "
3109,Magazine,"Our wealth care system reached a point years ago where trying to receive good care while paying a reasonable price became impossible.  Even if we have insurance through our jobs the plans are, for the most part, high deductibles with high co-pays and a very narrow network.  How are we supposed to develop a relationship with our GP if we have to find a new one every year or two?  What does that do to continuity of care and trust?  <br/><br/>Health insurance companies, pharmaceutical companies, hospitals, and other health care facilities in America do not have patients interests in mind when they set things up.  Their sole concern is their profit and if it comes at our expense that's the collateral damage.  If we can't afford the care we need it's our fault for not planning for the illness or the need for care.  It's ridiculous attitude but it's still one that drives many decisions made by the wealth care industry.  <br/><br/>I would bet that there are plenty of people, with or without health insurance, who have not received care they need because of how our system fails us.  We have to do a wallet biopsy to see if we can cover the cost before we can decide if we need the care.  That's not how health care is supposed to work.  That's why I call our system a wealth care system."
3110,Magazine,"Single payer system can effectively ""treat"" the three major factors identified by researchers that are noted in this article.  Decrease paperwork--We currently have to work with over 50 different insurers, all with their own rules and forms--one provider-one set of forms with one set of rules. Drive down pharmaceutical prices--one provider can drive a pretty hard bargain on drug prices--either give us the discount or we don't cover your drug--works pretty well in the VA system.  Limit the use of high-cost low value procedures--one insurer with system-wide standards for evaluating cost and efficacy introduces consistency--by establishing a standard that you must demonstrate before coverage everyone introducing or recommending new procedures would know wether the standard is met and therefore the procedure covered. Single payer is the best way to achieve these goals.  "

Pardon me, but the tunnel was damaged in 2012 and is already a Century old.  Did anyone ever consider building a NEW TUNNEL instead of repairing the old one?  Whatever the cost may have been, it is simply UNACCEPTABLE in New York City to put so many thousands of people through what will be torture for such an extended period of time.  Moreover, what is the reason that the L train couldn't have run from First to Eight Avenues?  I never understood why that link couldn't continue running, back and forth, on it's own. That would have helped the countless that don't need to cross the river when they take the L train and moreover it would have sped up crosstown movement for everyone to an extent by reducing the need for so many buses.

3133,SundayBusiness,"I had a near death experience and my kids were minors (septic shock). And, while in ICU for five days I was VERY glad I had done all this boring estate planning stuff. That whole âpeace of mindâ and not leaving an ugly mess that will poison familial relationships is No joke. "
3134,SundayBusiness,"I'm acquainted with a situation where someone was asked to serve as trustee for a relative's trust.  The individual agreed to serve.  After the relative's death the individual discovered that the relative had relied on a book and some information gleaned from the internet to write the trust.  Ambiguities in the trust, and the pour-over will, led to legal disputes that stretched over several years.  My advice: make it a condition that you be allowed to read the will and trust, and clear up any ambiguities, before agreeing to serve as trustee.  Require that an attorney review the trust if necessary."
3135,SundayBusiness,"Your attorney should keep the original will and your heirs should have his contact information. Lawyers have good systems for safeguarding wills, you probably don't."
3136,SundayBusiness,It is my understanding that you should not keep your copy of the will in a safe deposit box because in many states only the owner of the box can open it-- executors may have to get a court order to access the box to get the will.
3137,SundayBusiness,That makes it very convenient to hire the lawyer who drafted the will to settle the estate.  Be especially aware of statutory percentage fees for attorneys in certain states.
3138,SundayBusiness,My brother died many years ago in an accident at age 21. He had virtually no money or belongings. He had no will. My father said the worst part was all the extra paperwork and procedures that had to be completed because my brother died intestate. It stretched out the agonizing burden of dealing with his son's death. Don't assume that just because you have nothing you don't need a will. It's always about those you leave behind.
3139,SundayBusiness,"Believe me, you do not want to leave anyone you love to cope with your estate when you do not have a will.  There are magic words in some states, Illinois being one of those, which will make your Executor's tasks and the costs to your estate a lot less.  So a local attorney is not a bad option."
3140,Learning,"Vaping is absolutely a problem in not only my school, but every school in my area as well. If I had to guess, I'd say that in my school district, one in every four or five students vape regularly or have vaped before. So in a school with 2,000 students, about 500 vape. Ever since I arrived on campus as a freshman almost two years ago I seemingly have watched the vaping craze come to life right in front of my very eyes, I have still yet to walk in the bathroom without seeing a kid vaping in a stall. This year alone it has really reached some new lows, during basketball season I witnessed a cheerleader jump up and do a split in the air only for her ""air"" to fall right out of her sports bra and onto the court for everybody to see, oops. And you bet these kids are hooked. Several of the people I know who have been vaping since the entered high school are so addicted that now they will start to shake if they have not vaped in a couple hours, now that is sad. The article says that vaping makes you four times more likely to smoke cigarettes but that in my opinion isn't true. Vaping does lead you to smoke something else, not a cigarette, but weed. After vaping for a long or even a short period of time these students turn to weed as a new high to take them away from the stresses of school and life. So yes, it is a BIG problem and at this point I don't think there is anything we can do to stop this wave, and if you don't believe me, go walk into a school bathroom and open your eyes."
3141,Learning,"(Part 1)<br/>I think everyone needs to relax with all this talk of vaping being âa demonâ. This new way of smoking is just the more modern and safer alternative to smoking cigarettes. While it is a problem, and is not in the slightest bit healthy, it's no worse than any of the other ways that teens can be rebellious. Long ago before the era of vapes, kids smoked cigarettes to be cool. This may have evolved into vaping, which isnât much better, but it isnât like kids will just quit being rebellious all together. Even if we were able to eradicate vapes, kids would just come up with another way to show that they were cool. It probably would be no better than vaping for their health, and they probably would be negatively affected by it. "
3142,Learning,"pt. 2  Smoking has been demonized for so long in health  classes, describing the risks of giving in to ""peer pressure"" and destroying your lungs until they're a ""pile of cancerous waste"". Everyone thinks ""if I just vape, I have no risks, at least I'm not sMOkiNG!"", even I didn't know  there were other health risks from vaping. The kids with a real addiction are not the problem though, it's the ones that do it for fun in school. They make it so everybody that vapes appears like them in the eyes of authority. Nobody should be suspended for vaping in school though, especially if they're of legal age. Those that actually need help with addiction should be offered free counseling and those that don't should be genuinely talked to by somebody that has experienced addiction, and return the device to their parents. Punishing students and confiscating their devices isn't going to do anything, it could be damaging and hinder recovery to take it away from them so abruptly. However, every student that vapes on a school campus is responsible for doing so and can't complain if it is taken. If the concept of vaping without a reason to was considered as dumb as it really is, I don't think it would be seen as cool. Vaping to be cool is one of the most embarrassing things to do. It makes it so others that need it aren't taken seriously which isn't okay at all. We need to be understanding with people that experience the struggles of addiction, not punish them."
3143,Learning,"Sadly, I have vaped before. But I wasn't a fan.<br/>However many of my friends love it, they are very addicted. I walk into the bathroom, to use the bathroom, and what do I see? I group of 3 or more people just standing around hitting their various devices trying to get ""buzzed"".<br/>But my High School is different than Cape Elizabeth High, people do smoke, I walk across the street to get a drink or a snack after school, and if I go by the McDonald's there's a pretty good chance there is a student smoking there. Sometimes even one that I know.<br/>But these are all examples to the nicotine epidemic that is taking over high schools across the nation, it's bad. But schools don't do anything about it, unless you get caught.<br/>Even then all they will do is write you up, and take away your device. I don't think this is enough, there is nothing stopping the big groups of people in the bathroom, there aren't sensors or anything in the halls. I mean I've even seen kids in the back of the class hit their Juuls while the teacher is looking away.<br/>Schools need to be more heavy handed with punishments, however suspension is not the answer. You just gave them a day off to go get a new device to fuel their nicotine addiction. Health classes would be nice but I fear would also be unsuccessful if you compare them to how they've done in Sex Ed. Addiction Counseling seems to be the best answer in my eyes. The user has to want to stop for them to stop."

3150,Editorial,"This business of the NYT characterizing gerrymandering as somehow being a ""Republican"" tactic for consolidating political power is a wasted teachable civics moment: for more than 200 years, crazily-shaped voting districts have been a nasty, critical and fundamental tool used by all political parties. Stop cherry-picking about cherry-picking."
3151,Editorial,"Just in case your readers forget, you deservedly lost the argument about the Voting Rights Act back then. The Supreme Court invalidated the requirement that certain states must seek federal approval before they change their voting rules.<br/><br/>You said back then that the rule had worked ... but we still needed it.<br/><br/>You said then that we lived in era of blind partisanship on Capitol Hill, but in 2006 the rule received the support of an overwhelming bipartisan majority in Congress. <br/><br/>You rejected the claim that the formula was out of date by citing a study of election discrimination ... beginning in 1957!<br/><br/>Now you are up to your usual trick of calling anyone who disagrees with you a racist.<br/><br/>You conveniently forget that, with your enthusiastic support, courts have interpreted the Voting Rights Act to authorize the gerrymandering of districts along racial lines.<br/><br/>Have you no shame?"
3152,Editorial,"Republicans pass voting laws under the guise of preventing voter fraud.  Study after study has shown the fraud does not exist to anywhere near a level that requires legislative remedy. It's interesting Republicans view ""regulation"" as only necessary to suppress voting.  No need to protect consumers from harm.  Just regulate voting. They persist in passing these laws expecting the public to go along with the ruse.  The Supreme Court, supposedly the conscience of the American Constitution, buys the argument.  John Roberts, himself, stated that the impetus for voting rights legislation no longer existed in America.  In his view,  Blacks in America are ""Free at Last"".  I am sure all the Republicans on the court voted for Trump because ""Mexico will pay for the wall.""  Clearly bias is alive and well in America.  Especially on the Supreme Court.  "

But every voter who CAN vote SHOULD vote....we have to throw off the yoke of oppression by the Greed Over People party at every level, including local and states to make sure states are enacting voting rules amenable to easier voting, then federal oversight as well. <br/><br/>VOTE as if your life depended on it, because it appears that it does.

3161,OpEd,"The U.S. Census Bureau now publishes an annual poverty report titled the Supplemental Poverty Measure that takes regional cost of living into account. The report is changing perceptions about which states are poor and which are affluent. The most recent report shows that 14.7 percent of Americans live below poverty level. Despite its large economy, California is by far the poorest state with 23.8% of its residents subsisting below poverty level. New York ranks as the seventh poorest state with 16.0 percent of its residents below poverty level. Coastal states are well represented among the 10 poorest states:<br/><br/>1.

3163,OpEd,"Why doesn't ever consider the ability of ""bubble up"" economics to be a better way to run an economy?

He likes to take advantage of his government benefits also. What a pair! "
3165,Climate,Any question as to whether this is a conflict of interest there shouldnât be.

3167,Climate,"Only in Trump's swamp-free Washington do such pipeline dreams come true! All that government mpney saved to help offset his 30-person security detail, his $43,000 private phone booth, and all those first-class tickets. And his lobbyists even provided a free room for his daughter. How considerate!"
3168,Climate,This entire Administration is Exhibit A in conflicts of interest.
3169,Climate,"There is a difference between influence peddling and unethical conduct.  In influence peddling, under federal law as the Supreme Court interprets it, the prosecutor must prove a quid pro quo.  No such requirement exists for Director Pruitt to be fired for unethical conduct.  All is needed is proof that Pruitt accepted a continuing benefit from an entity which he knew was likely to have business with the EPA.      "
3170,Climate,"It is entitled individuals like Pruitt who think that they are above the law and ethics and this article covers it all. He thinks that he is the only one who can declare what is scientific as he disbands the very EPA science advisory boards that use facts and real data to make decisions on what keeps our air, land and water free of toxicity.  Let alone the climate change denial... Pruitt has tried to demoralize and de-mission the EPA.  Time to go back to O-K-L-A-H-O-M-A!"
3171,Climate,We all know it is a conflict of interest but this morally bankrupt GOP and the evil White House  lawyers will support it as is .  The man only paid 50.00 a night in a apartment owned by one of their people.  I can't wait for mid terms and the vote.  I just hope we can afford to go to the polls if the GOP start a trade war with oil countries by then.  They love to govern with past failed policies and I hope we can put a stop to that. 
3172,Climate,"Surely no one could possibly be surprised. We already know this guy wants to dismantle the department he serves for the public (at the most crucial time that it needs to be strengthened to keep US citizens safe). If only this nugget could be used in our defense against oil and coal industries that own this guy, if only consequences could come to this administration, then one could have hope."
3173,Climate,"Why do it? Sorry to hear the guy is so poor that he has to put himself in a compromised position. Cheap, cheaper, cheapest...or is dumb, dumber, dumbest?"
3174,Climate,"Pruitt, the perfect example of Trump's ""Opposite Philosophy,"" should be got rid of nonviolently on any workable grounds. This despoiler of our environment is the human equivalent of toxic chemicals."
3175,Climate,"EPA Secretary Pruitt had the use of a private condo, for only $50 per night, for only those nights he stayed there. That is a benefit available to few if any people, is far cheaper than any alternatives, and is provided by a principal of a firm that lobbies Mr. Pruitt's agency on behalf of its clients.  There is no doubt that this appears to be a conflict of interest. For that alone, Mr. Pruitt should resign or be fired.<br/><br/>The only unresolved issue is whether Mr. Pruitt's actions are also an actual conflict of interest. Further information showing an actual conflict could lead to criminal charges for Mr. Pruitt, the principal of the lobbying firm, or the lobbying firm itself.<br/><br/>A government investigation might elicit such information.  However, under the current administration, ""government ethics investigations"" are more oxymoronic than ever.<br/><br/>President Trump appointed various foxes not to guard chicken coops, but to pilfer them. Trump's tolerance for inappropriate behavior by his appointees is limited by the extent to which their inappropriate behavior makes him look bad. The quickest way to oust Pruitt is to have this reflect poorly on Trump, who has no problem throwing his lackeys under the bus.<br/><br/>Focus on the lobbying firm would reflect poorly on it, and could result in the loss of current or future business. It would warn lobbying firms to be more cautious in their efforts on behalf of their clients, and warn firms to exercise more care in choosing a lobbyist."
3176,Climate,Is this a conflict of interest? Why is that written in the form of a question?
3177,Climate,"The BEST scammers and cheaters.  Corruption, MUCH ???"
3178,Climate,"And Scott Pruitt really isn't in the job at EPA he covets, according to the New Yorker. He wants is to be the AG if and or when Jeff Sessions takes flight. Can we even imagine how corrupt that agency would become with Pruitt at the helm?"
3179,Climate,I would like to suggest that the American Association for the Advancement of Science offer Scott Pruitt an even nicer condominium and only charge him $40 per night for the nights he is there. It won't be bribery but he might coincidentally be inclined to consider science after he moves into the nicer and less expensive AAAS condo.

3193,Climate,The EPA âsaid that those standards were too expensive for automakers to meet and would ultimately hurt car ownersâ<br/>When did the EPA become an auto industry lobby?  Orwell would be proud.

3195,Climate,"What's wrong with the idea of leadership? It was the auto industry that convinced everybody that they ""needed"" a minivan. It was the auto industry that convinced everybody that they ""needed"" an SUV. Why can't the auto industry use the same powers and convince people that they need economical low emission vehicles? Could it have anything to do with the oil industry potentially losing money? Trump claims he wants to MAGA, well why not improve America's standing in the world by establishing leadership in vehicle efficiency and low to no emissions? The world is changing at such a rapid pace that any nation that does not adapt will fall behind. Nations need to think quality, nations need to think clean, nations need to be adaptable so they can move with the changes instead of trying to hold back progress. Rolling back standards is not the way forward."
3196,Climate,"Rather than MAGA, Trump's administration will remove the USA from any leading position in the technologies that will become standard in the coming decades. Without fail this administration champions industries and positions that belong to another era and forfeits any chance of American leadership in those fields that will be the foundation of the near-future to future economy. As a witty NYT commentator said a few weeks ago, when can we expect a Trump plan to revive the typewriter. Jurassic? These guys are pre-cambrian!"
3197,Climate,"Let US automakers know, as I have, that you won't buy junk cars that don't meet at least current (if not better) emissions standards. Trump's supporters won't care, but they are actually a minority, and businesses do seem to find a moral compass these days if their huge profits are on the line."
3198,Climate,I have a feeling Pruitt is putting on a show to save his job. He has had some bad press lately. 
3199,Climate,"Pruitt and a number of the Trump folks should be prosecuted for crimes against humanity and reason. <br/><br/>That Americans can vote these people in, for understandable but emotional impulses, says a lot about the tragedy that are our educational systems and our insulting level of public discourse. "
3200,Climate,"California, New York and any other state in the Union have absolute right to dictate their internal pollution standards as long as those standards are not lower than what the EPA requires.  The EPA can set minimum requirements.  However the states are totally within their rights to set tighter requirements that what is specified by the EPA.  What Trump and his criminals are trying to do is force increased levels of pollution where it is not wanted.  This is effectively the same as forcing poison down the throats of people who don't want to swallow it.  We need to get these monsters out of office.  America deserves better. "
3201,Climate,"This is all part of a longstanding trend to shift operation of the government in the public interest to private interests.  Using outright lies like ""regulations cost jobs"" and ""consolidation brings lower costs and prices to the consumer"" and all the while the pocket of the consumer is being picked."
3202,Climate,Doesn't the party in control believe that states should make their own decisions? I guess they mean unless the states disagree with the Republican agenda.
3203,Climate,"It's not Pruitt; he simply reflects the goals of our our current occupant of the White House. When you have a liar, thief, narcissist, and crook in the position of a real president, the result is the open and flagrant disregard of all laws and standards. So Pruitt reflects the same anti Obama attitudes as the one who hired him. This time it's the E.P.A. who is being attacked but it will not end there.<br/>They intend to role back our entire country and they have a good start. If Pruitt is fired, Trump is likely to fill the position with another incompetent fan.

Sadly, these will be overwhelmingly low-to-average income people, not the well-off and powerful (and some very particular sections of society), who fiercely supported the experiment.<br/>America - once the undisputed champion of the free market - would've relinquished this mantle because of the dilution of the trust and international relationships it has forged over the years.<br/>So ... you've got to wonder - is this really a worthwhile gamble?<br/>If China is behaving, why wouldn't you simply raise this with the WTO - get the support of other countries - and, if proven, punish them accordingly?"

When he first came to Niagara University, he was given the opportunity to twirl for the Buffalo Bills one game.

Even in her late 40s, she was still a beautiful, well presented woman.  She had been a stewardess for a major airline, and then a stewardess on an actor's private plane.  She married an airline pilot who also then piloted that actors airplane.  The two of them bought a B&amp;B in a great location.<br/><br/>There are many paths to success, and if some women see value and elect this path, they don't need others to protect them from themselves."
3227,Sports,"I had no idea the plight of the NFL cheerleader was so dire. Given the amount of money in the NFL, including the pay package for Goodell, these cheerleader playbooks and salaries seem like a cruel joke. I hope these women get what they deserve."
3228,Sports,1. A while back Sports Illustrated noted that it was forbidden for players and cheerleaders to date. Followed by a list of all the players who had married cheerleaders. It was a long list.<br/><br/>2. When the Rams moved back to LA they sent letters to all the cheerleaders ordering them to return all there Rams outfits which stated they would be sued if they failed to do so. One worked in my brothers office and she showed it to him.<br/><br/>3. Another Rams cheerleader bartender near my house. She told me they had to be there 5 hours before kick off. To be fair she really enjoyed it.<br/><br/>4. The cheerleaders in the video wearing red and blue are The Crystals from EPL team Crystal Palace not the NFL.

3230,Sports,"All NBA players must dress in business or conservative attire while arriving and departing during a scheduled game, on the bench while injured, and when conducting official NBA business (press interviews, charity events, etc.). The dress code banns fashions most often associated with hip-hop culture, specifically: jerseys, jeans, hats, do-rags, T-shirts, large jewelry, sneakers and caulk boots.<br/><br/>Hip-hop type clothing is not allowed to be worn by players to interviews, games (on and off the bench), charity events, or any other occasion affiliated with the NBA or the NBDL (now the G League). Violators of the dress code are fined and may be suspended with repeat offenses. The dress code was developed with the intention of combating image problems that have plagued the NBA in recent history.<br/><br/>Under current NBA dress regulations, if a player does not dress to participate in a game, he must dress in a manner suitable for a coach. In the NBA, a suit or a sport coat is required for coaches,[3] as well as a necktie."
3231,Sports,"NFL is a male sport, and sexy, bouncy women have always been the balance for the huge, tough jocks that play the game. I'm not a fan, but it seems that women must know they will be beauty-objects as cheerleaders, and secondary to the players. The gender discussion seems rediculous in this case, but the women should get payed more."
3232,Sports,"If this is such an oppressive system, why do hundreds and thousands of women show up for try outs and suditions, willing to do anything to be on the squad? That their pay is low is besides the point of the advertising they do, selling workout routines, advancing their modeling careers.  They get wined and dined by the wealthiest men in any given city, perks Iâm sure they donât want to give up. The bottom line is, the social prestige they derive from being NFL cheerleaders outweighs all the negatives described in this article. Why else would auditions be packed? "
3233,Sports,"Oh please, if a young woman chooses to objectify herself in this way it is her choice so crocodile tears only and I would hope she would make a better choice on how to spend her time."
3234,Sports,As is typical controlling women is taken to great lengths while controlling men not so much. And they are paid much more.

3236,Sports,I actually applaud the no sweatpants in public policy-if we could only make it universal. Since when did it become acceptable to wear pajamas to the airport? Would it hurt anyone to have a standard of decent dress? But I digress. 
3237,Sports,This is absolutely correct.
3238,Sports,"Except that you're wrong. <br/><br/>Along with the ""minutiae"" and ""gross and overreaching"" rules, cheerleaders are not only often paid less than minimum wage, they're also banned from personally benefitting from their work. <br/><br/>It's pretty much like being an NCAA athlete, but without the potential of a payday at the end of the nonsense. "
3239,Sports,The Cleveland Browns have never had cheerleaders and they could use some to cheer up the crowd.
3240,Sports,Probably one reason it is done is that the incremental cost is low - certainly wage cost appears to be minimal. Does their coach get paid millions? A higher minimum wage would improve things in many areas.

3245,Dining,"Anthony Bourdain got it right.  Walk away in shame.  Batali is lucky he escaped criminal prosecution.  <br/><br/>Unfortunately, he ""is the room where it happened"", to quote Hamilton."
3246,Dining,"I'm unclear why the Times continues to write these articles about how men who've committed pervasive sexual harassment and assault are trying to find/reinvent themselves.  These men have had plenty of the limelight during their careers, to the detriment of women around them.  Why are we not trying to find the women whose careers and lives were derailed as a result of Batali's harassment and abuse, and profile them?  Give them the opportunity for publicity and to let their talents shine.  "

3249,Dining,Mr Batali move to China or India.  Redefine yourself and enjoy cooking. The world is not America or the insanity of the extreme right or left that is gripping is today. 
3250,Dining,"Just like the garbage about Paula Dean, this is a mountain made out of a rock. People who do not like Batali are so quick to jump on the ""get out"" bandwagon for that reason only when they do not even know the man.  I don't either, but he has apologized and is seeking help and advice, I think he should go on and be bigger and better. Forget the critics and wannabes, they all are jealous and seek attention. Batali doesn't need them - only those of us who visit his restaurants. "
3251,Dining,For his own health I hope he's working out and eating more healthily.  He looked like a heart attack in progress. 
3252,Dining,"There seems to be at least some misplaced scolding going on here.  The restaurant/bar biz is pretty much an exercise in sophistry in the first placeâflattery everywhere, including at Battaliâs level, pretty much false consciousness from start to finish.  The alcohol culture greases the wheel, including, letâs face it, Anthony Bourdainâs wheel, although he appears to keep his head on straight with respect to women (and men).  Food (and drink) can facilitate human interchange, but in the restaurant/bar biz itâs chiefly about moneyâsociality is a means to an end.<br/><br/>We excuse some alcoholics with talent, such as Fitzgerald, Hemingway, Christopher Hitchens, letâs throw in Jim Harrison, from Battaliâs sometime American home away from home (the list could be greatly extended), but we start getting self-righteous when fine-dining is the topic, where flattery is at least cloaked with myths about being prudent and civilized.  To be frank I find more civility, less flattery, in what William Least Heat Moon called âthree and four calendar restaurantsâ (a remembered quote).<br/><br/>Cut it out.  Yes, everyone needs to cut out the abuse (funny word, thatâuseful, but it resists adequate definition) of women and girls.  Dignity and respect are due everyone (letâs throw in the guys, too), but alcohol and the restaurant âcultureâ are only one more public place under attack by the self-righteous (I notice they like to attack churches, tooâinterestingly, synagogues and mosques, etc., not so much...)."
3253,Dining,I love that Joe Bastianich comes out of this with his hands clean. What. A. Joke. I worked as a waiter in a few high end NYC places and the things you would hear about both of these guys were scary. They were convicted of stealing money from their employees some years back. You did not want to have anything to do with either of these guys.  
3254,Dining,"one commenter notes: ""'MeToo' lynch mob justice must be rejected. ...The entire MeToo movement is becoming a cauldron of endless questionable accusations. It has turned into a man-hating and man-shaming movement, which is doomed to fail.""<br/><br/>This reminds me of the 1950s and 60s when black people were told to ""take things slowly"" in advocating for greater civil and human rights. Women have been treated ABYSMALLY--in private and public spheres--FOREVER, and the MeToo movement is redressing that. Men, in particular, may not like being judged quickly and harshly, but TimesUp, women are tired of waiting! The movement may not be perfect, and it may not always be fair, but that's not surprising given the outrage that's been stored up for so long. As for Mario Batali and other Masters of the Universe who miss their seats of power and wish to return in a few months, they've missed the point entirely. It's not about your career and your business, but how you TREAT other human beings. If Batali wants to pass the gates of Rehabilitation, he has a lot of very painful soul-searching to do, and that takes place--if it does at all--over the course of years...  "
3255,Dining,He should  NOT get off stage.  He should cook and let the public decide if they like his food and we should stop all of this gratuitous and condescending commentary
3256,Dining,A couple of years in a soup kitchen feeding the homeless might convince me.

3261,Dining,"I will give you the benefit of the doubt and assume you did not actually read the article (or ones it linked to).  Batali is not accused merely of ""rude behavior.""  he is accused of sexual assault, which is a felony, including one episode where he allegedly sexually assaulted an unconscious woman.  If you actually think this is no big deal, then you need help as badly as Mr. Batali."
3262,Dining,"I agree 100%. Not just the memory lapses, but look at him - his physicality indicates over use of alcohol. If he came out saying that he was getting sober and seeking therapy that would be a something."

"
3264,Dining,"Thank you for your reply Judy. Change came app. 1980 not now. Countless women took advantage of it and did not enable or co dependent the predator.<br/><br/>The era of the male white knight coming to the rescue and saving the damsel in distress is over. Men cannot fight for women and pull their chestnuts out of the fire. It is called equality.<br/><br/>Change is not finally coming if you co depend or enable the predator as mentioned in my post.<br/><br/>As mentioned, predators live for the co dependent or enabler. It's what keeps their hopes alive.<br/><br/>There were predators 5,000 yrs. ago, they are predators today and probably 5,000 yrs. from now.<br/><br/>The way you paint them into a corner and render them harmless is not to enable or co depend them.

3265,Dining,And Gwyneth!
3266,Dining,"Ha! His PR people got this story in the Times, and Batali humbly declines to be interviewed for it. So obvious a pity ploy. Go away and stay away. And oh, the Rwanda thing is a nice touch, too. But Jose Andres is so much more genuine than little Mario."
3267,Dining,"What? I wouldn't expect in a NYT #Metoo article that an accused would be given any benefit of the doubt but it does say he is deeply introspective and friends say he is seeking counseling. How do you know none of this involves treatment of women? Wouldn't common sense say it does? That just sounds like a feminist allegation, and one that as usual doesn't feel obligated to provide any proof."

3270,National,And why shouldnât these teachers walk out? These conservative republican states tried to lower taxes at the expense of their education systems. It is simply a travesty that folks like hedge fund managers who contribute absolutely nothing to society are paid billions of dollars while the folks who are responsible for our childrenâs futures are paid like housekeepers. It is just yet another example of why our economic system is doomed to fail if Wall St is allowed to continue to pillage &amp; plunder whatâs left of the American middle class. Elizabeth Warren is right: itâs basically the average American against the rich bankers and fund managers and we must not lose.

Who exactly is stopping you? You'd get 'pension for life' and 'three months off'!"
3272,National,"It is time to switch from pension to defined contribution plans with strong matching with investment in the same funds that support pensions now. Many states, to include CA, IL, and MD to name a few already have billions in unfunded liabilities because they promised large pensions and now have soaring life expectancy. It will not be long before the pension payments (if not already) will exceed outlays for new teachers. A defined contribution plan will allow for better planning and allow for the use of targeted wage increases to retain teachers. This will result in a net increase in pay. Additionally, the funds will be invested in the same fund used now for pension obligations as well as being portable should the teacher desire to move. This will allow for true budgeting to occur and give teachers better flexibility."

3288,Obits,Indeed Winnie Mandela was a complicated and imperfect human being but her sacrifice and commitment to abolish apartheid was unwavering and absolute.  We should be honoring and celebrating her life.
3289,Obits,"Sounds like a person who lived two lives:<br/><br/>The first devoted to courageously pursuing freedom for others; the second characterized by violence, selfishness, and self-aggrandizement. <br/><br/>Plenty to applaud and plenty to denounce."
3290,Obits,"The opitome of the Strong Black Woman she was and I am forever convinced that she was Mandela's true love, no matter how many wives came after her, regardless if even he realized it. She's an irrevocable piece of SA history and a pillar of that struggle, she will be sorely missed. "
3291,Obits,"Is this how the NYT will report on the death of Robert Mugabe? Is this liberal America's view of what an African patriot and freedom fighter is? Winnie Mandela was a monster, and her lionization smacks of a tacit acceptance that, other than her once-in-a-lifetime former husband, murder and brutality are to be expected, and the best that can be hoped for in that part of the world. This is a grave insult to the many courageous men and women striving to bring true freedom and democracy to Africa's people. "
3292,Obits,"When will corruption ever end? In Southern Africa, the corrupt are comfortable with a public reputation of such. In Europe and the States, the corrupt go to great lengths to hide their wayward decisions. It's all the same. Ms. Mandela is no different. Yet, her Nelson Mandela was very different. He was pure. She was not. "
3293,Obits,"Winnie Mandela is the true face of the African anti-colonial movement.  She was a corrupt torturer who built a Palace for herself in Soweto on the backs of the poor.  She imitated the worst excesses of power by stealing, intimidating and killing her own people without being held accountable.  She presaged the corruption of  from Mugabe to Jacob Zuma and a generation of corrupt leaders that have kept Africa poor."
3294,Obits,"George Washington was notably summary and cruel to traitors. Winnie Mandela did not have the luxury of a formal judicial process or the luxury of the spin of victors but she did as all leaders before her embattled in war have done and probably with greater personal sacrifice. <br/><br/>She was left by her husband a mother of young children but then she won a war.  The movement she led contributed to the ending of his incarceration and insured a more unified people upon Mandela's release.  Clearly she was mistreated and wrongly characterized after Mandela's release.  F. W. de Klerk, head of the National Party, oversaw Apartheid and was responsible for the killing of many and oppression of millions. He was absolved by the Truth and Reconciliation tribunal set up to try those who had committed crimes against humanity under apartheid. He was absolved though he was found to have lied to the Commission. In contrast, Winnie was held to account by the Commission. She, beaten and tortured, a victim of apartheid, was convicted for acts of an alleged ""associate"" but de Klerk was absolved for acts  attributed to his ""underlings."" Nelson Mandela was held in prison because he refused to denounce violence as a tactic in the fight for freedom. He is rightly recognized as a hero to the world. Winnie is a victim of sexism and racism and the intersections thereof. This NYT article wrongly gives short shrift to that. Winnie was and remains a hero--an able general in the fight for freedom. "
3295,Obits,"I find a lot of these comments maddening. Nelson Mandela was a great man, a hero to the people of South Africa and to the world. Winnie Mandela, whatever her contributions to the end of apartheid in South Africa, was a monster. She ordered the torture and killing of several people, not just Stompie Moeketsi, a 14 year old boy. Winnie Mandela was present when Stompie was tortured by her personal ""bodyguard"". Stompie's throat was slit while on her property, and his corpse thrown into the rubble outside her house. Read the reports of the Truth and Reconciliation commission. She was no hero."
3296,Obits,"Paulo Freire said, ""The oppressed, instead of striving for liberation, tend themselves to become oppressors.â  Unfortunately, Ms. Madikizela-Mandela life is yet another example of this road to perdition.  "
3297,Obits,I think the sign language interpreter at Nelson Mandelaâs memorial said it best.  Life is a bloody mess.  
3298,Obits,"There is a spiritual reckoning when you consider MLK's 50th anniversary of his assassination by the United States government and the death of a fiery objector of apartheid. âI am the product of the masses of my country and the product of my enemy.â As brilliant and courageous of a leader Winnie Mandela was to South America, I'm certain she would accept a friendly retort ""of being a product of GOD that should empower the masses in defeating the enemy."" "
3299,Obits,"A giantess with flaws, like the rest of us! R.I.P."
3300,Obits,"A conflicted and confused woman who was a brave freedom fighter none the less. Both attributes are part of her. And, we must treat her rationally for what she was."
3301,Obits,"Heroes are fictional constructs; real-life people are more complicated. If you want to learn more about South African history check out these two very intense books: 'Country of My Skull,' by Antjie Krog, narrating the findings of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (where Winnie Mandela appeared); and 'Born a Crime,' the memoir by Trevor Noah. Worth reading!!"
3302,Obits,"Winnie Madikzela-Mandela was a childhood heroine. Most Americans discovered the anti-apartheid struggle in the 80s but it had been going on for decades.  My parents marched against apartheid in England when my mother was pregnant with me more than 50 years ago.  <br/><br/>For millions of people, Winnie Mandela was the face of the anti-apartheid movement and Nelson Mandela's voice.  The torture and harassment Winnie endured is unimaginable.   She was told that it would stop if she would only shut up and be a good wife and mother.  But she refused.<br/><br/>The price Winnie paid for being a African revolutionary WOMAN was heartbreaking.  If her views became more extremist than her husband it was because she was on the front lines of the struggle, fighting daily.  Winnie was surrounded by hangers-on, South African government spies and 'allies' who resented her.  Many of the trumped-up charges against her were, the result of the South African government trying to drag her down by any means.<br/><br/>I will never forget the day Winnie and Nelson walked out, hand and hand, heads and fists held high.  It was one of the happiest days of my life.  It hurts to realize that when Nelson Mandela had to choose between becoming the leader of South Africa or standing by the woman who had stood by him for so long, he didn't choose Winnie, but the years apart had taken their toll.<br/><br/>I hope Nelson is there to greet Winnie, now that she is finally at peace, and to honour her courage and sacrifice.  I always will."
3303,Obits,"I would think that if a powerful oppressive state hounds an individual for 30 years (1964 - 1994), that person is bound cracker somehow. I'll even be blasphemous here in thinking that that cracking up process might be easier to resist if one is jailed and subjected to to a routine.<br/>The moderates who engineered the present hodgepodge that South Africa is today are revered. But they didn't bring about a nascent  enduring  just society and former oppressors seem very satisfied with the result in which all their previous priveledges are intact. Winnie Mandela's alienation from the transition process to achieve the reconciliation to today's ineffective kumbaya-nation is something I think future historians will be not all positive about. "
3304,Obits,She was a strong person who never succumbed. I respected her and still do
3305,Obits,"A quote of Ms. Mandela, ""I am a living symbol of the white man's fear..."", speaks to the power of her presence. Rest in Peace."
3306,Obits,"Why did a world hero like Nelson Mandela divorce Winnie?  His was the voice of reason and reconciliation - hers was the voice of violence and retribution which is always attractive to many in South Africa, even today."
3307,Obits,"<br/>Winnie Mandela was as complicated as her beloved husband, Nelson was inspirational. This closing remark ""it doesnât take that much digging to remember the truly awful things she has been responsible forâ tends to linger on the brain much deeper and longer than the positive and good works her husband was responsible for in his lifetime.  With all due respect, I found her ""unsettling contradictions"" made her an odd duck, at the best of times."
3308,Obits,She is and will be. The brutality that created her and her wrongs do not fail to acknowledge what her life represents that apartheid was cruel and needed to end.
3309,Obits,"Without a source to back you up, I cannot accept your statement that Stompie Moeketsi was necklaced.   Does not the Truth and Reconciliation Commission say his throat was slit?   Please name your source or refrain from unfounded assertions.   "
3310,Obits,"Comparing W.M. to George W. is spurious. If Martha Washington had sentenced any traitors to death, it would have cast a shadow on the integrity of the battle for independence against our British oppressors. Then again, the Washingtons weren't imprisoned and tortured for decades. "
3311,Obits,Flawed leaders are just that.  Please donât try to justify their failings. 
3312,Obits,"Milton,<br/><br/>Did you ever see a mob ""necklace"" someone<br/><br/>and how horribly that person died..."
3313,Obits,"By the time she came to power, the evil government was gone.<br/>She could have done good; instead she did similar to what the past evil government did.<br/>She personified much of post-colonial Africa: Freedom to do . . . what? "
3314,Obits,"Actually, if you want to play the game where South Africans have to be shoehorned into American models, Steve Biko would be the SA stand-in for Malcolm X, and Winnie Mandela necklaced his supporters with reckless abandon.  What she said represents the ideological stance of the ANC until the end of apartheid.  Socialism and the anti-racist struggle were bound up together both for honest ideological reasons, and to ensure support from the former Communist bloc.  At the end of the Cold War, and with victory in the anti-apartheid movement, the socialism piece was effectively dropped as policy.  "
3315,Obits,Thank you Dr. for your corroboration ...and willingness to help them even though you likely drew the unwanted attention of the bad guys.<br/>Again thank you!
3316,Obits,"One of the most striking ironies of those times in South Africa was that the medical community in the state hospitals operated wholly independently. We treated all comers, to the extent of our ability in well equipped hospitals. When necklacing and other forms of abuse of presumed collaborators was rife, from 1986 onwards I sometimes did not go home for 2 weeks. In one shift we would repair arteries from kneecapping (a security force favorite) and try and keep necklacing victims painfree and calm as they died. Those were schizophrenic times and I wonder if any of us came through unscathed."
3317,Obits,"RM, Did she, or did she not, harm her cause?  It is ironic that in the U.S., people are arguing about statues erected to honor Confederate generals. They at least put their lives on the line in battlefields and did not succumb to personal thuggery. "
3318,Obits,"I understand Nelson divorced Winnie and married someone else. I can't say I know how it works in Heaven, but the divorce suggests to me that he may not be there to greet her. Perhaps instead she will be greeted by those killed by the barbaric ""necklacing"" she advocated, or by the youngsters she was convicted of killing."
3319,Obits,"She did succumb to the corruption of power, and I don't think her suffering is an excuse for the suffering she brought to others. Her brutality must be acknowledged, as we acknowledge the iniquities of all leaders no matter how just the causes they championed."
3320,Obits,"Always interesting to see denial in action.   Was not apartheid the pathological and systematic implementation of a vicious hatred of black people?  It's inaccurate to describe the former South Africa as ""a country led by white people.""   Those people did not lead.   They bludgeoned, murdered, and stole their way to tyranny."
3321,Obits,"Surely one reason for the divorce was politics.   He could not continue to lead with her disgrace covering him.  He had to cast it off.    <br/><br/>Regarding your choice to paint Nelson as good and Winnie as evil, you are being simplistic.  History is always complex, more so in the contexts of colonialism and racism.  There can be no surprise that ""the voice of violence and retribution"" was attractive to Winnie and continues to be attractive to so many around the world.  Please remember the history of rampant lynching in the US.   Those whites who actually implemented or passively allowed it were attracted to violence and retribution, most apparently only because they feared an idea:   the idea that they were not racially superior."
3322,Obits,She betrayed him by cheating on him with his colleague. That is not an easy burden to bear after 27 years of incarceration.

3328,Learning,"The ban on sports betting should be overturned. It should be overturned because it adds more to the atmosphere and culture of humans competitive nature. We experience this atmosphere every year in march when college basketball teams that nobody knows about become fan favorites across the nation (Loyola). Major sports events, like march madness and major league championships are not âgateway drugsâ for sport betting. Most people who bet on these games are just in it for the fun. There are, of course, many who do bet on other games too, but for the most part, bracket pools and square sheets are it.<br/>	There is not much that would be lost. The only thing I can see that would be lost is the honesty of athletes. There is a chance that some athletes may bet. There is much more that will be gained, however. The revenue brought in by teams will be increased. With betting, people who are interested in the outcome of their bet will be far more likely to watch those games than people who have nothing on the line. With the case for sports betting get closer to being approved, I believe that we will see sports betting in the near future. The sports culture that used to be will be back and competitiveness amongst fan bases will be at a highpoint. In the end, I do not think that there is enough for the hearing to go badly for sports betting."
3329,Learning,"When I imagine a great leader, the image that pops into my head is that of a tall, white, man, because of the fact that I grew up in Western Civilization, which has been predominantly white and patriarchal. Thus, the leaders most well-known to me are people like Churchill and Lincoln And while people of color like Barack Obama,  Sun Yat-Sen are recognized, frankly, women are not - the only ones off the top of my head are Margaret Thatcher and Hillary Clinton, neither of whom strike me as that great of a leader compared to, say, Lincoln.<br/>We must be aware that along with this historical patriarchy, humans also evolved in a world much unlike the modern day; for the 99.4% of human history that took place before the invention of agriculture  might made right. It is natural then that there would be a biological inclination of leadership toward men - who,  are on average larger and stronger compared to women. But do not let social conservatives use this ânaturalâ idea to argue that women are worse leaders than men. Just because something is natural does not mean it is good. Now that we are aware of the inbuilt biological tendencies that we all possess, we must consciously divert our thoughts to compensate for this.<br/>With that in mind, the characteristics I believe a great and good leader must have are the following: The ability to know what they know and what they do not know, the willingness to keep an open mind to all ideas, and the will to be decisive when action is necessary."
3330,Learning,"I donât necessarily think that sports betting is such a bad thing. I understand where some people are coming from, saying how if it gets out of hand it can get crazy and lead people down the wrong path. However, I think that if itâs controlled and done in moderation it can be fun and harmless for anyone who chooses to participate. The idea of sports betting is to have a little fun while mixing gambling and a sport that you enjoy, itâs intentions are not to cause people to gamble until they go in debt. There are some people though, that take it way too far because they simply canât control themselves. But thatâs an issue we deal with when it comes to regular gambling anyways. So why should we ban sports betting just for a few people who cannot do it responsibly?"
3331,Learning,"The act of betting on sports is not immoral in my opinion, although it can lead to other more serious issues, such as point shaving and game fixing.  I do not agree with the 1992 federal law banning sports betting in most of the country, as I believe  the individuals right to privately and honestly wager on something they love trumps the concern of illegal activity. "
3332,NewsDesk,"I was in navy boot camp near Chicago when MLK was assassinated. We had to patrol our perimeter fence of the whole camp all night because the rumor was that a man with dynamite and arrows -- yes, dynamite and arrows -- had been captured on base. I heard of no real problems or damage.<br/><br/>On boot leave in Texas, no one even mentioned it, except my best friend who said that he was ""glad the SOB was dead."" I was shocked: Really? What is your deal, I thought. (He had serious psychological problems; he was a wife-beater among other things. At last count, he was separated from his fourth or fifth wife, I lost count. Not a happy camper.)"
3333,NewsDesk,"In my family those who cheered the assassination of Martin Luther King in 1968 gleefully voted for Donald Trump in 2016. One of them recently told us she is ""more Christian"" than those of us who voted for the Democrats. For some people good and evil must be defined as black and white, I suppose."
3334,NewsDesk," I hope this is not too off topic, but it IMO it very hard for young people today who have the choice to access opinions far removed from their own to understand the physical insularity and the vast gulf between groups of those segregated times.  A few years ago I was told by a Central American diplomat (blonde, blue-eyed &amp; therefore<br/> inconspicuous) who was an undergraduate in (white) in Mississippi when JFK was murdered in 1963 how the campus erupted into a celebratory party to end all parties with bonfires and dancing. She was still horrified 50 years on. This celbration was for the murder of the President, a white Catholic. I find ""glee"" for the death Dr. King less than 5 years late  not at all far-fetched."
3335,NewsDesk,"I was days shy of my 10th birthday when Dr. King was killed. I grew up in Arlington, Virginia, and recall days of curfews, sirens and police cars in our Hall's Hill neighborhood as nearby D.C. erupted in hurt and anger. My parents discussed whether or not my birthday party would take place in the midst of such heartbreak, chaos and confusion. It was a terrible time for everyone. I did have my party that weekend. Who could have predicted the horror we'd all experience again just two months later when Bobby Kennedy would also be murdered. "
3336,Well,"I'm very disappointed that a calcium scan is not ""a ticket to be reckless"". So where can I find one?"

3338,Well,Ouch!  So many rules!  I would have been doing a lot of lying at the baby/doctor visit.  <br/><br/>And thatâs the truth. 
3339,Well,1 year of paid family leave and these insane debates about parental sleep deprivation will end. 
3340,Well,"I think each family needs to figure out what works best for them.  I cannot imagine co-sleeping, my husband and I have a king size because we each like our own space, but I have friends who love it, and they are good parents too.<br/><br/>I have a 6 month old baby girl, who is breastfed at night, she still gets up once around 3am.  She gets combo fed during the day and she is perfectly healthy (note to all you lactivists - there is more than one way to feed a baby) and she has never slept in our bed, nor do I feed her in bed.  Our bed is for 2 things only, sleeping and you know what.  She slept in our room in a Rock n Play next to the bed until she was 4 months old and got too big for it, since then she has slept in her crib every night.  We have a recliner in the nursery that is used for nursing and snuggling, and I found it much easier to get up and go to the chair then bring her in bed because when she was newborn she pooped every time she nursed and needed a diaper change anyway.  Once she stopped pooping like crazy, she started sleeping longer stretches, and then she needed a diaper change because it was so wet.  Either way I was going to the nursery right across the hall from our room.  <br/><br/>This is what works for us.  Parents need to follow their instincts and so what is right for their family.  But, if you are inebriated in any way you should not share a bed with a baby, that could really be dangerous."
3341,Well,"My three children were parented in the âprone positionâ which means in bed with us and nursing at nighttime. Everyone slept well, and are alive today. I read âThe Family Bedâ when I was a young mother, and felt  that our decision was best for our family. "
3342,Well,"I had two children.  Both were breastfed for 2 years+ and stopped when they wanted to do it.  Naturally, according to their own needs.  Both of them when they were infants slept in our big bed between us.  First one nursed during the night 4 or 5 times.  Neither of them had a pacifier, not ever.  I loved this time the most and it had deep meaning for all of us together.  My second child stayed with us much longer in bed but we didn't force her out.  She weaned herself away from co-sleeping and joined her older sister later on.  I loved it much too much!  Now they are grown and secure, independent, creative, beautiful women.<br/><br/>THE POWER OF SUCH LOVE IS AWESOME!  Awake and asleep dreaming together with your baby.  I miss this time in my life with them but really loving means letting go.  They were our LOVEMATES.  Never roomates."
3343,Well,We formula fed my now-3-year-old and he awoke every 2-2.5 hours hungry to eat. He also started sleeping through the night after a couple of nights of sleep training at 8 weeks. Enough with the breastfeeding crusade.

It was the artists, and the rich who supported them, the ones that made the city an exciting place to live. It was fun to walk around all the quaint neighborhoods with different personalities. Now the construction of glass structures, so typical of developing countries wanting to look first world, is what attracts people to NYC.

3352,Magazine,"I'm sorry, but I just don't like this story. There is total disconnect among the 8th grader mugged during the school day by someone wearing a ""hood"",  the ""wild"" presumably teenaged kid running around with drugs and guns and trouble making friends, the drunken, punchy young man aspiring to be a writer so much that he carries his manuscripts around in a box after fistfights, and finally the pensive, mostly righteous hunter spending time on a therapist's couch analyzing his own fears while glorifying the ""culture"" which hunts and owns guns recreationally. <br/><br/>If he handed it in as a school assignment I would tell him to re-write it. I get the point that he doesn't agree that assault rifles are necessary to the continuation of the gun culture as he prefers it, and he is even bold enough to bring that up in one on one conversations with the old men he hangs around with (and in the NY Times.) 'Nuff said. Good for him. He's right.<br/><br/>However, I wonder if he realizes the real fear he has, which is that the common sense gun laws I prefer would indeed exclude him from owning any kind of gun. I think he knows that. He is clearly traumatized, obsessed, and to a great extent, anti-social. A careful psychological profile would probably indicate that he is exactly the kind of person who might have a breakdown, or who would overreact, or who would rationalize the way Trevon Martin's murderer did. <br/><br/>He should stick to writing fiction with the help of an editor. This is an awful story."

Admirable, and I respect those friends of mine who do just that.  The rest of âgun cultureâ -if that means the fetishization of hardware meant to kill human beings - is something I donât get and I donât understand the its celebration. "

3355,Magazine,"People don't want to ban AR-15 style rifles because they any more effictive or dangerous than other semi-automatic weapons. It is because they look ""scary"". It is because people who know nothing about guns think the scarier a gun looks the more effictive it is. <br/><br/>What are we going to try to do next? - Ban muscle cars for being to agressive or fast."
3356,Magazine,"I am glad for your glimpse of reason about assault weapons, but we need to hear more from citizens like me who are in the great majority, don't own guns and don't want them around.<br/>I, too, grew up with guns but I learned to be scared to death when one of my brothers almost killed another, thinking he was breaking in.<br/>And a hunter's sadness does not match that of a vegetarian daughter like me, who would bring home a brace of beautiful mallards, which I would pet and cry over. My father stopped."
3357,Magazine,"So I'm 12 and it's Christmas morning and pop hands me a stack of targets and a few boxes of rimfire .22 to go target shooting. His .22 is mine now. Later in the day we head to the farm of a family friend, walk across the field and prop up a target.<br/>I know how guns work now.<br/>About ten years later I'm in the service, and carrying a pistol on a law enforcement boarding at sea. It's my job to watch the crew on deck while the boarding officers and vessel captain do their inspection. I've been trained, FBI pistol courses, use of force, shoot/no shoot, instruction from ATF agents in illegal weapon recognition.<br/>But none of this is as unnerving as what happened a few months earlier when I was the boarding officer and going thru the inspection in a pilothouse with a captain when I heard a person behind me.<br/>""Oh, I just have to use the bathroom,"" the crewmember said. I could have been dead. My guy doing the crew security on deck defended with ""he said he had to go."" I never did a boarding with that guy again.<br/>On this day, I'm doing crew security on the deck of a boat we're boarding &amp; inspecting, and a crewman keeps jamming his hands in his pockets. I can't see his hands. That's bad. As many times as he keeps jamming his hands in, I keep asking him to pull them out. Third time he does it, he says 'I'm cold, what are you going to do, shoot me?'<br/>I said nothing but took the clasp off the holstered .45 and put my hand on it. Crewmans hands came out stayed out.<br/>Both our hands stayed cold."
3358,Magazine,"Thanks. You give new perspective to readers who may be ignorant as to why anyone would want a gun. <br/><br/>I liked your comment about relying on the police; ""when it's a matter of seconds, police are only minutes away."" <br/><br/>To push back a bit, the words hunting, and plinking do not appear in the constitution. Neither do self defense or tyrannical government. Assault and rifle are nowhere to be found.<br/><br/>When the 2nd was written everyday citizens had just used their guns to help oust a foreign army - those guns were by default military weapons. The argument that the founders would support a ban on military weapons seems pretty specious.<br/><br/>One argument against scary-looking guns is that when the constitution was written the only guns that existed were ""muskets"". There were, however, canons, howitzers, Puckle Guns (machine guns - look it up). They had rockets with red glare and bombs bursting in air. The constitution doesn't say ""...the right to keep and bear *certain* arms, shall not be infringed."" <br/><br/>Be sure, the left wants to repeal the 2nd amendment. They will take baby steps to do so, but the goal is repeal. <br/><br/>Our constitution also makes citizens 18 and over legal adults. At 18 you can vote, enter into contracts, be tried as an adult, be executed, serve in the military, police forces, or become an armed guard. If they're going to repeal the 2nd they better repeal the 26th too. <br/><br/>Oh, BTW, the alcohol ban is a separate issue that's probably unconstitutional at its core."
3359,Magazine,"âI felt safer knowing that gun was there.â David, I feel less safe knowing youâre carrying a gun. I could care less if you want to have a hundred guns in your home, but when you start bringing them with you, thatâs a PUBLIC safety issue, like it or not. And Iâm sad to read that you spend most of your time âthese daysâ at home. Thereâs a whole wonderful, fascinating and engaging world out here for you. Someone that can write with the skill you obviously have should be able to enjoy it without fear."
3360,Magazine,"Suggested last line: ""And as we left the mall, I was almost run over by a distracted mom in an SUV.""<br/><br/>The point is that we can fear a lot of things, but a gun is a fairly ineffective way of addressing a fairly remote fear.  We need to evaluate fears rationally, take reasonable measures to address them, and live our lives without dwelling on them.<br/><br/>Guns get in the way of such reasonable evaluation.  Carrying one amplifies, in our minds, the remote chance that they might become useful. Having to defend the decision to carry a gun amplifies that feeling even further. One consequence of cognitive dissonance is that the most irrational beliefs tend to be the most firmly held.<br/><br/>Moreover, the gun companies and the NRA work actively to increase our fears, with the complicity of the press.  Instantaneous news makes every shooting and every gun incident into a national headline. And if we all fear guns, we all want to have them.<br/><br/>We can continue to devolve into this maelstrom of fear, or we can decide to be rational.   The fact is that we're safer now than any humans in history. But carrying a gun does very little to increase that safety; it often, in fact, makes the carrier less safe."
3361,Magazine,Should the author really be allowed to<br/>be anywhere near a gun?
3362,Magazine,"Multiple times in the article are statements about ""need"" for a firearm, ""need"" for an AR15. ""Need"" indicates justification. Who ""needs"" a Porsche? Who ""needs"" $1000 sneakers? More importantly, if ""need"" is ever the issue, who decides, based on what standard, that one is in ""need?"" Talk about ""need"" is to presume unavailability unless some government affirms artificial ""need."" Anyone talking about ""need"" is talking about prohibition, and prohibition should not be arbitrary. "
3363,Magazine,"I was impressed that the author left the long gun he was selling on his front seat instead of brandishing it in public. The yahoo's, unlike the author, just want to show off. Maybe their hands are too small. We all have our fears and seeing people in Starbucks with weapons makes me sick, angry and scared. Imagine a barista seeing a gun approaching him from the other side of the counter. Is the gunman going to hold him up or order a latte. Doesn't he or she have a right to a safe work environment? "

3366,Magazine,"To the writer, owning gun is a sport which has become his culture. This sport and the culture are killing 5 year old kids. For the sake of these kids the writer should sacrifice his culture. Itâs not worth the fun he is having. A country canât be defined by individual cultures. The common good must prevail. The idea of democracy is to do the largest good for the largest masses. "
3367,Magazine,"While I support your rights as a hunter and the fact you wisely believe AR15's etc have no business in the tree stand, what concerns me is the culture of fear in which you live. The second amendment should be repealed and then replaced with a well organized gun registry (unlike Canada's disaster). Contrary to what the NRA states I have never been robbed ever at gun point in my country. Yes, the bad guys always manage to smuggle illegal fire arms into the country but unless you want to live in North Korea this unfortunately is the price you pay. I could not live in the state of paranoia that Mr. Joy experiences. It is time the US seriously examines gun control because outside of a war zone the US is still the only country in the world with the number gun deaths rivals the aforementioned war zone."
3368,Magazine,"This is a very thought provoking article, explaining a culture that is completely foreign to me. But that doesn't remove my antipathy toward weapons of war being normalized in our society and I am glad to see someone like Mr. Joy, who has been raised in a gun culture, understanding the difference. There is absolutely no reason to have an AR-type weapon unless you intend to efficiently kill as many people as possible."
3369,Magazine,"Mr. Joy might have pointed out to his friends arming themselves against 'tyranny' that if and when, God forbid, our government moves against its civilian population, it won't be with muskets or with AR-15s, but with tanks, mortars, and poison gas--just ask Syrians.  My son the soldier will tell you, that assault rifle will not protect you against 'tyranny'.  Your better bet is to vote against a militarized police force.  "
3370,Magazine,I do not carry a concealed weapon but feel safer that 8 million Americans do.  They are the most law abiding upright group of people in America and far safer than even police officers.

3374,Magazine,"A strange and sick culture. Here in Nova Scotia, I donât know anyone who owns a gun."
3375,Magazine,"Thank you David, well written. Now, all we have to do is convince the small percentage of people, and spineless politicians, that do not understand the damage being done by allowing the sale high velocity military style weapons.<br/>Further, comprehensive, nation wide, back round checks and registration would go along way in keeping weapons out of the hands of those who should not possess them.<br/><br/>As as former Combat Infantry Sargent, I have chosen to never again possess a weapon... any weapon. However, for those that do, and I think most gun owners understand this, gun ownership, by default, carries a huge responsibility.<br/><br/>Oh, one last thing, in most situations it might be best to NOT always have a round chambered... unless you are living in the wild west."

3378,Magazine,"Totally agree. Good analogy with seatbelts. Don't forget wearing a helmet while riding a motorcycle. Our state law on motorcycle helmets got changed one year because the governor at the time was a motorcycle guy who didn't like wearing a helmet because it ""spoiled the experience"". Unfortunately for the rest of us, when these people get injured or killed whilst enjoying themselves, it costs everyone in the system in terms of the medical/legal expenses resulting therefrom."

3380,Magazine,"Thanks for the thoughtful comment.  I've noticed a lot of people advocating for treatment and therapy for the author and I've looked into it myself but at the (reduced) rate of $90 a session and a recommended 8-12 sessions it is outside of financial ability right now which is something that most commentators don't seem to think about when they flippantly say ""get some therapy"" etc.<br/>The madman did not shoot my son but I am not willing to rely on the mercy of a madman or my words to keep him safe going forward.  I would, without hesitation, murder anybody who threatened my child with a gun.  If it means going to jail, I am also fine with that.  At the end of the day all I really care about are having my children safe, provided for and knowing that they are loved unconditionally.  I would gladly go to jail if it means protecting them.  Have you read some of the news stories, even reported on by the NYT, about young kids who were killed by lunatics over road rage?  Google it.  It's heartbreaking.  The only time my gun is loaded is when it is on my hip and I have taken great precautions to make sure no child could access it or load it in my home.  I am aware that having a gun involves risks and based on my experience that day, the risk of having one greatly outweighs the risks of not having one.  Again, thank you for your concern.  "
3381,Magazine,Heller decision. Written with purpose and an utter lack of regard for precedent or american security. By scalia--probably at the bidding of the traitors who run the NRA 
3382,Magazine,"I don't know if it really is as simple as that, but I do agree that during the 10 days I spent in Japan visiting my daughter in 2011 I felt safe.  We visited the smalll town where she worked as an English teacher for three years and much larger cities including Tokyo.  <br/><br/>My point is that there are differences between Japan and the United States. A significant difference is the homogeneity of the population and density of the population in Japan compared to the United States.  There is not the diversity of races and cultures and histories in Japan that there is in the United States. I don't believe that immigration is the problem that it is perceived to be the United States.  It helps, of course, that Japan is an island nation and it is not as easy to get there as walking across a""line"" in the dirt or swimming/wading across a river.  <br/><br/>I am not a demographer or a sociologist, but my impression is that Japan does not have the inequalities in income, health care, and education that exist today in the United States.  So maybe there is less motivation to turn to a life of crime or the persecution the ""other.""  <br/><br/>Like other commenters, I feel sorry the author of this fine piece.

3390,Upshot,"<a href=""http://StudentLoanJustice.org"" title=""StudentLoanJustice.org"" target=""_blank"">StudentLoanJustice.org</a><br/><br/>45 million Americans - One in five adults with college debt. <br/><br/>$1,500,000,000,000 outstanding debt.<br/><br/>A real, lifetime default rate of at least 50%. <br/><br/>This money is never going to be paid. <br/><br/><a href=""http://StudentLoanJustice.org"" title=""StudentLoanJustice.org"" target=""_blank"">StudentLoanJustice.org</a>"
3391,Upshot,"Couple of problems. You can not compare countries with so much difference in social insurance structures. Many Australian students are on welfare payments to support them while studying. All are covered by medical benefits.      But the down side is that most who go to the better unis had parents pay 20,000 a year in high school fees to get them in. They also have limited choice in good universities. Except for a few small schools they are all federal institutions that donât play football. Almost no one would leave their hometown. And there are only at most two major institutions  in the largest cities. And they are mainly surviving on the backs of international student numbers in their commerce faculties (Australiaâs second largest export). Also donât forget that us Aussies pay a marginal tax rate of 45%."
3392,Upshot,Big omission: many foreign countries limit the number of students in their pursuit of degrees that have few employment opportunities. These universities take some responsibility in guiding students for their own interests as well as the student. US universities on the other hand will churn out graduates in medieval studies as long as the money is green. If the US adopted other countries payment policies without their other restrictions it would take bad situation and make it far worse.  
3393,Upshot,"One key difference between Australia and the US and UK (not sure about Sweden) is that most Australian university students study in their home city and remain living at home with their parent(s).  Hence, the need for a loan to cover ""living expenses"" while at university is lessened, and not included in the Australian loan scheme.  There are separate funding schemes to assist Australian students from remote and regional communities."
3394,Upshot,I tell young people I know to move to Australia.
3395,Upshot,Why? Are we the American taxpayers giving Billions of dollars of tax breaks to corporations that are hiring deeply  indebted college graduates?
3396,Upshot,"Why should education spending be any different than defense spending?! To the contrary, education spending should be far greater as no child or young person anywhere should be expected to pay for tuition. Education taxes just like SS ones are paid by everyone equitably. As for living expenses for college years, students and their parents must go through financial counseling before embarking on that journey. Lastly, universities spending needs to be reigned on as many spend fortunes on futile programs. "
3397,Upshot,"I am an Australian living in the US, and went through the Australian system. It was simple and easy to understand, and fair and equitable to pay off quickly. In my view the inability to borrow living expenses is one of its strongest points - not its weakness. America suffers from 2 problems Australia doesn't - the first is that Australian students go to university locally, and live at home or locally. Americans students have a cultural expectation of going  to have an experience far away from parents. Secondly, one of the reasons Australians stay locally is that most Universities are of similar quality - what counts, including to employers, is what you do and how well you do it, not where you do it. "
3398,Upshot,"I grew up in the Hasidic community in New York, and I always dreamed of one day breaking out of its shackles and getting an education. I was a single mother when I finally made it to the beautiful campus of the only graduate program within my driving distance (I had gotten my bachelors online). Sarah Lawrence College. I was surprised when I got a financial award notification ""awarding"" me some twenty thousand dollars a year in loans. I managed two years of part time schooling (to avoid debt) while raising my son entirely on my own, while working full time. By the third year I was no longer able to make the tuition and a professor helped me write a letter to the president pleading for more aid. Their response was: sorry, no. I dropped out. I still can't believe it. I'm incredibly driven and hard working and do the best with my circumstances. But in this American education system, when I was in need, they made it plain that they had no interest in educating me. They wanted just my money. My. A single mother with an estranged community. What an education its been indeed - in greed. I have gotten farther and learned more since I gave up on college."
3399,Upshot,"Just so long as US taxpayers are not asked to pay off student debt. I can't see any justice in asking bricklayers or bus drivers to pay more taxes so that future hedge fund managers and lawyers can lord over them. If anything, force colleges to use some of those obscene endowment funds to lower tuition."
3400,Upshot,"Comparing the United States with significantly smaller countries like Sweden, Britain and Australia is unscientific and unhelpful."
3401,Upshot,"âMaybe the first step is acknowledging that possible ideas for improvement donât stop at the border.â Logical advice but one thatâs a non-starter in this country. Ideas from other countries hardly have a chance when so many who could benefit would hardly be able to find them on a map. We canât even fund our primary and secondary schools properly. And with so many fat fingers in the student loan pie, any real reform is bound to fail in our lobbyist-beholden Congress. Special interests, corporations as citizens, and money-is-free-speech ethic will inhibit significant reform until there is money to be made from reforming the student loan industryâor any industry for that matter. A sickening state of affairs."
3402,Upshot,"The college debt situation threatens the future of the US. The best &amp; brightest may not be able to take on debts, or may may be forced to choose careers for which they are overqualified.<br/>Meanwhile, Europe is investing in its best &amp; brightest. Even undocumented immigrants who meet the qualifications for university entrance do not pay tuition. For the long term, I'm putting my bets on Europe to produce the most effective young work force."
3403,Upshot,"What is the interest rate for a non-student loan for someone that is 18, no collateral and not employed?  I am sure it is higher than 6%.  Once they graduate, if they can find a lower interest rate, the debtors should refinance.  The 50% of taxpayers that do not go to college are giving up quite a bit by providing access to the billions in cash and an interest rate well below market."
3404,Upshot,"Only let in kids who achieve a certain score on tests . . . despite the advertised test score requirements, in Australia it is clear that that is not true.  Most students in most degree programs did NOT achieve stated test score cut-offs.  The government has recently collected data about the percentage of students in degree programs that met the test score requirements and it is publicly available.  Basically, an Australian who wants to attend uni will almost certainly find some university willing to admit them, even if only on a provisional basis.  Sports/extracurriculars - depends on the institution.  Mine has an increasing focus on sports and has spent a lot of money on new sporting facilities, etc, in recent years.  Agree that there is much less of the cultural expectation to ""go away"" to college."
3405,Upshot,"I am an American in Queensland, like you.  The OP system (which is ending this year) depends on a complex algorithm of not just test scores but also school quality and, I believe grades.  Nevertheless, the government has recently required all Australian universities to report on the admissions profiles of students in every degree program.  It is clear that a vast majority of students in most programs do NOT meet the selective cut-off requirements that most universities advertise.  In some cases, as many as 75% of students in a given program were weaker than the stated admission requirements.  "
3406,Upshot,"I don't know anyone in Australia who took out private loans. What the article fails to acknowledge is that there are government payments to students for living costs (so the experts' concerns about not being able to borrow for living expenses are overblown), and culturally it is normal to work part-time while studying. That said, it is getting more and more difficult to establish eligibility for a student allowance, and there is no way the allowance covers all living costs (originally it was sufficient that a student could get by without working)."
3407,Upshot,And given the tax-deductibility of said interest....

(This is why office break rooms tend get disgusting.) Oh, you're not a maid? Neither are the rest of us."
3411,Upshot,This is the type of research that drives me mad. Of course we would all be happier and our partnerships therefore more harmonious if we never had to do a task that was distasteful to us!

3413,Upshot,"Tremendous news.  Paying for all the chores we really hate will save many marriages.  <br/><br/>What are children being taught if cooking, cleaning, and other task a family shares are considered to stressful and result in divorce.  Oh, but there are people who will perform the work and are just so happy to save their parents marriage. <br/><br/>Children will grow up believing they can be happy at work and home if only work as a family...just play. <br/><br/>Another separation of those that have and those that serve the upper class."
3414,Upshot,Sometimes the spouse and I have a money-fight where we throw fistfuls of money at each other and have a good laugh. Then we get the maid to clean it up for us.
3415,Upshot,"Wait, research shows that having enough money to pay for things you don't want to do makes you happier?  What a REVELATION!  Wow, if only we all had extra money to outsource unsavory household chores - we could all have happier marriages.  This research is only barely useful to the 10% of people who have enough money to do this but aren't doing it.  The rest are either wealthy enough and do it already, or the bottom 40% of income earners (which probably don't read the New York Times to begin with) who make less than $50k/year can't afford to follow this advice.  People are already thinking about this and making trade offs to save for college, pay off student debt ahead of time, save up for a house, etc.  Thank you captain obvious - now subsidize my maid service to save my marriage.<br/><br/>This research and the context in which it is presented here is elitist at best and completely blind at worst.  "
3416,Upshot,"I am trying to understand the mindset of the commenters here who apparently feel that they are too good to clean up after themselves. They apparently believe that their time is so valuable that they should pay recent immigrants or other low-wage workers to clean up after them. I can understand why people who can afford the expense make this choice, but I hardly consider it admirable. "
3417,Upshot,"True, but why worry about grammar when the premise of the article is so elitist?"
3418,Upshot,"The article isn't saying to outsource ALL of the housework; that's hardly possible unless you have a live-in maid. A twice-monthly cleaning isn't magic because the daily chores still need to be done, unless you don't use any clothes, dirty any dishes, don't create any dust, and don't walk on the floor, don't use the toilet, etc. In other words, the only way that a house stays clean between bimonthly cleanings is - gasp - if somebody actually does a lot chores in the meantime."

3420,Upshot,What makes you think that house stays clean between visits? That's why they're so glad to see me.
3421,Science,"This is nicotine, one of the most addictive substances on our planet. All vaped carcinogens aside, this highly additive substance is being marketed to children for lifelong dependency. Brilliant business model on the surface, but itâs time for the law suits to start rolling in."
3422,Science,"I caught my 13 year old son with a Juul. He used his Christmas money from his Grandma to purchase it. I smelled fruity smells in his room, and eventually found the Juul and confronted him about it. Vaping has been widespread at our local public middle school, and every couple of weeks new kids are getting caught. It is also widespread at all of the private schools in this area. These kids don't understand how dangerous vaping is, and with all of the anti-smoking education would most likely not have started smoking cigarettes.<br/>Juul is a horrible company. They should be sued in a class action lawsuit, and State attorney generals should sue them for marketing to kids. The design of the pod is made to be easily concealable, and look like a USB port. The fruity flavors are marketed at children.<br/>Juul is also getting large amounts of venture financing. The VCs who are investing in this disgusting company should also be ashamed of themselves. I guess in America people will do anything for a buck. "
3423,Science,"What a shame that so much of the good on smoking in the last 10-20 years has been undone by vaping.  My father in law died of COPD last year after smoking for 40+ years.  He had quit a few years prior but the damage had been done.  Its a terrible way to die and if you saw someone dying of COPD, you would never pick up a cigarette or an e-cig in your life.  "
3424,Science,"In case you were wondering if the tactics used by these corporate predators sound familiar; according to an article in Forbes magazine a couple of years ago:<br/>""Big tobacco companies like Reynolds and Altria have gotten into the e-cigarette business in the past several years, and they now own the four biggest brands, including VUSE and MarkTen, which are sold in convenience stores and big retailers like Wal-Mart.""<br/>Now that you all understand this, is the trend reported here in the NYT much less surprising?"
3425,Science,After all the decades of striving for a smoke-free society I honestly don't understand how and why this ridiculous product and activity is being allowed to flourish. 
3426,Science,"The NY Times recently published a puff peace on the new FDA Commissioner, Scott Gottlieb, who postponed any regulation of vaping devices until 2021. originally intended to start this year. This is enough time to create millions of more nicotine addicts and handy decades long addiction profits for the industry he personally was invested in. Greed trumps everything."
3427,Science,"I know a few men who had been habitual cigarette smokers who stopped smoking after vaping for a short period of time. One seems to still vape. The others do not and also do not smoke. So I think for a habitual cigarette smoker, these devices could help. But the whole industry markets these things to look cool and taste like candy or fruit. That may be an issue. The smokers I know who kicked the habit mainly used ""vapes"" that tasted like tobacco. They gradually cut back and then gave up the vaping."
3428,Science,"Schools should be trying to use this topic as an opportunity to do what they supposedly do best: prepare young people for the challenges of being an adult.  Educate and counsel kids on the subject of addiction--in all its forms.  E-cigarets  may be the first such challenge these young people face, but it won't be the only one by a long shot."
3429,Science,"It's actually perfectly clear that there are no serious negative consequences to nicotine use. <br/><br/>It's also pretty clear that nicotine addiction is not an actual thing. A dependence? Possibly. Certainly in the case of smoked tobacco, but that's not nicotine in and of itself. It's doubtful that nicotine is addictive outside of smoking."

3447,Insider,"I have often thought that photography holds many similarities to playing defense in baseball.<br/><br/>Watch a young baseball player and they use youth and speed and luck to try and get to the ball, while the veteran knows the hitters and their tendencies, allowing for better positions ahead of the play. The seasoned player is standing where the ball is likely to be hit prior to the hit occurring and is therefore more likely to catch the ball.<br/><br/>Compare this to what Mr. Peterson did before hand: scouted the location and asked the press secretary how the event would play out. He ran the visual possibilities through his memory of other photo possibilities and made a decision where to position himself and what lens to have on hand. As the scene played out, he was in an advantageous position to catch the image.<br/><br/>The performance of Mr. Mathis might have been luck, but Mr. Peterson`s pre-planning and positioning was what made the image possible.<br/><br/>Excellent work by a major league photographer.

As white men themselves, they were able to climb those ladders too, and I and my family still benefit from those two generations of hope and opportunity.

3476,Politics,"Reid, thank you for your thoughtful reply.<br/><br/>I love your idea of removing the NRA from the argument; and I, too grew up in rural areas where hunting is a beloved tradition that is not going away. Many of those hunters and families were and are dear friends.<br/><br/>What is the reasonable solution, in my view? Common sense elements are a great starting point:<br/><br/>1) There should be no loopholes for background checks. These checks help protect us, and they are easily avoided at gun shows and through private sales.<br/><br/>2) My guess is that you don't believe the 2nd amendment should allow for private possession and use of surface to air missiles, or a shoulder-mounted rocket launchers. Similarly, it is reasonable to ban assault weapons, and buy them back at fair prices from the current owners. They are weapons of war, of mass killing, that are slightly modified to be semi-automatic. Australia did exactly this, and they have not had a single mass killing since. <br/><br/>Also, not a single hunter I know would ever use an assault weapon to hunt. They are not as accurate as a good, single shot rifle, and it is a lot of work to remove extra bullets when dressing game, and preparing it as food. The rare person who shoots at animals with assault rifles is viewed with disdain by real hunters, and the few examples I've heard about often involve alcohol use.<br/><br/>3) Ban magazines of more than a few bullets. A lot of these tragedies end when the perpetrator is reloading a magazine.<br/><br/>Sound good to you, Reid?"

There was no need and no emphasis upon a central National, Federal Government.  In trying to establish ""independence,"" the misguided ""founders"" took America down the wrong path, the wrong road, the wrong lane of dependence upon a central government.  This has been the bane of the United States (and not a balm) for over 240 years of its existence.  Ronald Reagan was correct, ""Government is NOT the solution; Government is the problem.""<br/><br/>The Federal Government, operating out of the swamps of the Potomac, has no connection with the environmental problems that exist anywhere else in this land mass.

There are two diametrically-opposed tracks being a teen can take.<br/><br/>Social media is not the key factor here, but rather a preference for social media over in-real-life interactions... which is generated by difficulties with intimacy/ attachment, not by the existence of media (however addicting).   <br/><br/>The Parkland teens seem like a very bonded, socially-skilled, warmly connected group of friends.  Thus social media can be used in the most beneficial ways.<br/><br/>Depressed teens, alone in their rooms on Reddit, are there because they have trouble connecting with people -- social media merely fills the void.<br/><br/>Mental health issues among teens are due to lack of emotional self regulation born of lack of secure attachment, which sources to early childhood.  Overuse of social median and bullying through media have co-arisen with a less securely attached cohort of kids.<br/><br/>We have to parent small children with secure attachment foremost in our minds.

She could have prevented tremendous loss of life, but she either didnt care enough to speak up or she shared much of his ideology.

Gibson needs to focus on just that - making the classic guitars that made them famous and make them very well. "

3566,SundayBusiness,"Juszkiewicz's wind-down can't come a moment too soon for me.  My white hot animosity to Henry goes much farther back, to 1999-2000, when he took a flagship piece of music software (which I'd become rather expert in) called Studiovision, authored by then-newly acquired Opcode Systems in the early years of consumer digital audio production, and strangled it to death, laying claim to its code for projects that never materialized, and denying interested parties (from investors to users) from any kind of purchase or sourcing of the code that had become the professional livelihood of tens of thousands (if not millions?) of music producers around the world. For them, it forced a transition to competitors who were decidedly less elegant in their solutions to various production issues.  For me, it was the beginning of the end of my rocky, but personally-satisfying, career in music production (I'm now in healthcare) and I lay much of it at the intransigence and insensitivity of Henry Juszkiewicz,  'turnaround guy'.  Gibson's fate today was foretold as far back as the late 1990's.  The man is a string of failures and half-baked ideas."

3570,SundayBusiness,"One more thing to remember. There are ""Chibsons"" -- Chinese copies of almost every Gibson model -- available on the internet for a fraction of the cost of the real thing. While the Chinese guitars are not as well made or playable as the original, sadly, most guitar players are hardly aware of the differences -- especially when you play the guitar through an amplifier.

3572,SundayBusiness,"In 1964 wintertime I discovered an old pair of my motherâs riding boots, ankle- high brown leather with a thin strap which crossed the front and helped to secure the foot along with the side zipper which was on the instep side of the shoe. The soles of the boots were also leather, so that when I wore them outside they allowed me to skate to school along the sidewalks, covered in a thin film of ice and snow from the bitter weather. I did not feel feminine in them, because I associated them with the new mod hipness from the Beatles Carnaby Street British Invasion that was February 1964 when the country gathered at 8:00 on Sunday night to watch Ed Sullivan. In that same month I was invited down the street to see a guitar owned by an adult male neighbor, arranged by my mother so that I could see a real electric guitar. It was in a beautiful coffin-like case, thick-walled and sturdy, black, with a golden interior of plush whatever that fur is inside of guitar cases. A brand new 1963 Gibson Les Paul Traditional Pro III, Honey Burst finish, a golden glowing guitar in a golden furry bed. It created light as the lid was lifted,  like the Ark of the Covenant. The owner let me hold it and play it, and the ease, the silk the soundâ¦ nothing like it. I was a novice, so when I heard him play some jazzy riff it was like those boots had brought me to another world."

Their guitars are not that great but with a high stickty price. "
3575,SundayBusiness,"A shame that he ran the company into the ground, but you could see it coming. The big Gibson bus, the Gibson showroom/showcases in Austin, the courting of coolness, like Gibson wasn't already the coolest. A damn shame."
3576,SundayBusiness,Proud owner of Gibson es335 Guitar and a Gibson F5 mandolin. Nothing I own matches the quality or delivers the joy more than those instruments. American made. Nothing else compares.
3577,SundayBusiness,"For years Gibson quality has been hit or miss, and the greedy expansion into ""lifestyle brand"" BS smells like what happened at Harley-Davidson:  the suits come in and cash in on the venerated brand name while letting the core of the business wane.  Ultimately quality matters, and the price/quality ratio of Gibsons has long been out of whack.  The best examples of gibson designs from their golden era of the 30s and 40s (for acoustics) and the 50s and 60s (for electrics) are today being produced by boutique builders like Collings and other smaller, hungrier companies that concentrate on making fabulous instruments instead of logo-themed merchandise that has nothing to do with music."
3578,SundayBusiness,"Collings Guitars down in Texas has proven that an American manufacturer can build brilliant assembly-line guitars and make a profit at the same time. Fender does the same. Gibson can't. The company has tried to do the car thing that almost killed American auto manufacturers: stick on more chrome to get the highest possible price, and let the manufacturing slide. Henry's latest brilliant idea was to put auto-tuners on everything, a totally useless idea (you can buy for $20 excellent digital tuning aids for guitars -- all you have to know is how to turn a knob. If $20 is too much, you can get an iPhone app that works well enough.) He was, in other words, trying to stick another piece of chrome on his product, hoping it could then compete with really excellent guitars coming from the big manufacturing countries like Korea and Japan. If Gibson is to be a really good guitar company again, it needs to get rid of Henry, it needs to get rid of that debt, and it needs to return a focus to manufacturing. Bankruptcy will help. The brand can still be revived: Henry's hurt it, but hasn't quite managed to kill it yet."
3579,SundayBusiness,Gibson went south when they went south. 
3580,SundayBusiness,"As someone who knew Les well for over a decade, and called him ""friend"" in the true sense of that word, I can assure you that, sadly, he himself would not be surprised (and would be saddened) at what is happening.  He liked Henry quite a bit (so do I), but I am certain, based on what I know about Les, that he would have told Henry (and maybe did) that when you have a successful brand, you stick to the brand; i.e., if it ain't broke, don't fix it.  Henry's attempts to ""diversify"" were wrong not simply because he ""ran into the euro,"" but because he should never have attempted them at all.  Maybe he was well-intentioned.  But then, we all know that line about ""hell"" and intentions..."
3581,SundayBusiness,"There are currently a number of small manufacturers in the US producing much better guitars at similar prices. Essentially, they are building guitars the way Gibson used to, largely by hand but also with the aid of modern technology and they are also incorporating what luthiers have learned since the 50's about what makes a guitar sing and play. Its a shame Gibson went down the road of consumer electronics and gadgetry rather than just trying to make the best guitars possible... "
3582,SundayBusiness,"Luthiers, piano-makers, etc., Remington, etc. etc. etc. Someone below remarked about ""the suits"" - I don't know if I agree with that completely, but the relentless (and often fatal) pursuit of growth typically begins when the visionary founder of something decides to exit, or dies, or whatever. Someone, loving the product line and seeing potential pays a lot for the company (or brand), and now they have to make it back. It's sad, but it's also the price of progress. Things come and things go -- we all die, companies included - they just have longer life spans than individuals. It will all be OK in the end. "
3583,SundayBusiness,"This is a failure of Gibsonâs product management compounded by their lack of vision. It started with Ibanez picking their pocket in the 80âs and continued in the 90âs, albeit on the other end of the spectrum, with the Paul Reed Smith brand. Specifically, Gibson eschewed the entry level and mid range price points, kicking them to Epiphone brand. Fender embraced the entry level, and applied emerging manufacturing methods and offshore factories to produce affordable, well playing versions of their own, equally iconic stable of guitars and basses. It was very important that those instruments said âFenderâ on the headstock.<br/>Fender built a brand, Gibson built a shrine and then had the audacity to think they knew what to do with other challenging businesses? "
3584,SundayBusiness,"Actions speak louder than words but when your words include, âIt is what it isâ, the distance to recovery must be daunting. I want a new guitar to become an heirloom. Gibson doesnât make them anymore and that doesnât bother me."
3585,SundayBusiness,"OK, I own three Gibsons - an SG, a Les Paul, and an ES-345. I also own a Fender Strat, a Taylor acoustic, and a Martin D-28. I am in the market for a Gibson J-200 acoustic-electric also, or a J-45, or a Gibson Dove or Hummingbird. <br/><br/>I would gladly pay for a Les Paul Black Beauty, if it didn't cost as much as several months pre-tax income. I love these guitars.<br/><br/>So, what happened? Well, one thing is that Gibson has made the dealers very unhappy. A dealer must commit to a large year's worth of inventory in order to remain a dealer, and the cost of inventory is pretty high. Guitar players are notoriously cheap, and they want decent prices. <br/><br/>For me, it will be a shame if Gibson no longer produces the great guitars of the past. "
3586,SundayBusiness,"The first point to make is that Danny Hakim does not explain, in one or two sentences, why the decline of the euro made the purchase of this Philips division disadvantgeous.  The implication is that the cost of noneuropean products in the supply chain outweighed the export market for the finished products.  That's fine, but some explanation belongs in the article.  Economists often talk about the advantages of a devalued currency for the export market.  The point here must be that this Philips division had trouble competing within Europe with Asian imports with a devalued euro.<br/><br/>Gibson is an iconic brand.  Its real cache in guitars is in jazz (electric) and blues (acoustic and electric).  My principal guitar is an ES-335.  If Gibson were to go out of business, though, one could probably buy other brands, like Ibanez, that would provide a very similar guitar at a similar price.  Or, you pay someone to build a custom guitar based upon the 335.  I think Eastman makes a 335-style guitar, and there are probably some very good ones.  I have one of the first Eastman Pisanos produced, I love it, it feeds back at higher volumes, however, and it's basically an acoustic guitar with a pickup, not good for rock.  <br/><br/>I donât see any problem with the auto-tuner idea, in principle.  "
3587,SundayBusiness,I'm not worried - the best of Gibson will survive. Apparently Gibson was pulled out of bankruptcy once before and was rebuilt based on the incredible strength of the Gibson brand and the quality of their products.
3588,SundayBusiness,Maybe this is why BMW asks the CEO to step down at age 60 even if they have record breaking sales during their tenure. Leadership is not permitted to become old or stale.
3589,SundayBusiness,"Unfortunately, this article may give non-musicians the impression that Gibson makes only electric guitars.<br/><br/>As a few other readers have noted, Gibson has a venerable history of producing outstanding acoustic instruments. In particular, the best of its F-5 model mandolins and Mastertone 5-string banjos -- perfected in the 1920s -- set the standards of quality in their categories.<br/><br/>But by the time a surging interest in folk and bluegrass musics hit in the 1960s, Gibson was concentrating on electric guitars for the rock 'n roll market -- to the point that it had to consult with acoustic instrument collectors and historians to rediscover exactly how it had constructed those classic banjos and mandolins four decades earlier. <br/><br/>Gibson briefly succeeded in reinventing them (notably with the F5-L series mandolins, made closer to the original specifications of the firm's legendary acoustic engineer Lloyd Loar in 1921-24). Indeed, the relocation from Kalamazoo to Nashville may have been part of a Gibson strategy to reconnect with the country music markets for both its acoustic and electric products.<br/><br/>But the carving and assembly of superior acoustic instruments is an especially labor- and craft-intensive business. While Gibson quality has fluctuated, independent luthiers have produced consistently better creations at competitive prices.<br/><br/>My prediction: In a bankruptcy, look for the C.F. Martin company (famed for its guitars) to acquire Gibson's acoustic lines."
3590,SundayBusiness,After reading all the comments it seems Gibson was slipping in quality while raising prices.  That's a bad formula for any business no matter how iconic.
3591,SundayBusiness,"Nashville-based?  Maybe now, but the âvenerableâ part must surely be from their decades in Kalamazoo.  They were founded in Kalamazoo &amp; were here longer than theyâve been in Nashville.  Sigh... maybe if theyâd stayed put.  I bet at the time the move seemed as much like selling out as auto tuning does today. "
3592,SundayBusiness,"Hate to say this, but these days the Chinese built Epiphone LPs sound every bit as good as the Gibson LPs built in the US. The only real difference are the superior finishes and pricier electonics on the Gibsons, but otherwise they don't sound any better than the cheaper Epiphones. Doesn't Gibson see this as an indictment of their guitars? They should, because the public isn't fooled. "
3593,SundayBusiness,"The American guitar business is a bit like the car business.  The instricnic value of stuff made years ago is greater than the value of the new products.  So perhaps we should have a little sympathy for Mr. J's clumsy attempts at fixing what wasn't broken.<br/><br/>The problem is, many businesses hit a rough patch and hire a numbers guy.  Someone whose done well in a completely unrelated business.  It works fine when selling toilet paper, but when it's Nikes or BMW or Nikon, it takes someone who grew up with the product and has a ""feel"" for what makes it special.  Otherwise, it's like putting Donald Trump in charge of the government.  They don't know what they don't know.<br/><br/>For the next round, Gibson's owners need two-person team.  A life-long professional guitar player and an accountant.  "
3594,SundayBusiness,"Great interview and story, and kudos to HJ not ducking the tough questions. "
3595,SundayBusiness,"In the early 20th century, long before Gibson became famous for their electric guitars, they were the original American innovators with acoustic instruments, in particular with the mandolin. They re-imagined the European bowl-backed mandolin into the modern flat backed instrument with a carved top and optional violin-like sound holes or an ornate scroll. The pinnacle of this was the Loyd Loar F5 model, which sell for hundreds of thousands of dollars these days. At that time, Gibson banjos, mandolins, and acoustic guitars were the premier instruments of American folk music. Manufactured by craftsmen, they were affordable and they sounded like heaven and they lasted.<br/><br/>Iâm sorry to now see Gibson, like so many other manufacturers in this country, caught up in this race to the bottom to compete on the global stage. We have lost something here, and itâs bigger than Gibson."
3596,SundayBusiness,Letâs all just breathe. The demand for guitars ebbs and flows but Gibson is going to be just fine. The coming-of-age screamers and whalers still dream about the legendary Les Paul. The silky smooth lounge players still lust over the stunning L-5. Only the luckiest can afford them. But Gibson has accessible models through their lower trim and Epiphone line to satisfy most budgets. Will some investors lose a few bucks over this corporate debt?  Yeah. Will the worldâs premier guitar brand skip a beat?  No. 
3597,SundayBusiness,"Bad timing coupled with movement away from core competencies have sounded the death knell for more than a few companies.  Gibson has had a great run, but when technology can turn talentless hacks into million selling artists, guitars are a lot less necessary if they're necessary at all. Anyone who winds up owning the company needs to dial things back and see if the market comes back to them.  As to Mr. Juszkiewicz, he has not been a proper steward of the brand.  He needs to go.  "

If you want a custom shop model, just like Fender also offers, you have to pay for it with your family's blood, the keys to your kingdom and few extra dollars from a lottery you may never win.  In other words their US made stuff is very expensive!  Very good but very expensive."

Of course, it does; there is a direct line between Israel and Muslim anti-Semitism. This is indisputable. The violence and hatred with which Israel treats these people ends up inspiring violence and hatred among the ignorant and oppressed Muslim populations in other places. Historically, Muslims and Jews got along very well, certainly far better than Christians and Jews. In the 20th century, the growth of anti-Semitism among Muslims was a direct response to the actions of Israel. This needs to be understood: in the Middle East, Jews are not primarily victims; they are, primarily, victimizers. This is not surprising; it is quite common for abused peoples to turn around and abuse others. Israel, and its decades long campaign to take as much Palestinian land as it can and oppress the entire Palestinian population as it does so, is the problem; it is not the solution. "

Modern cancer immunotherapy is much more targeted and less crude but is based in the same idea. "

While Mr Ghandour is understandably loathe to spend more money, did it ever occur to them to apply cladding to the exterior?

Invariably, the work was done without a permit or the involvement of a Licensed Professional Engineer or a Registered Architect.<br/><br/>For most projects in NY City and the Surrounding Municipalities, Building Permits are required before any alteration, renovation, or repair work can be done.  If you proceed with such work without a Building Permit and you are caught, you, the homeowner, may become subject to fines and, in some cases, criminal charges.<br/><br/>Once you have approved plans, you can then solicit bids from contractors.  Any contractor who questions the plans should be excluded from the bidding, no matter how cheap his price.  You will pay in the end when the Engineer / Architect / Inspector turns down the shoddy work and you have to redo it.<br/><br/>In NYC, the Engineer / Architect must follow the project to completion.  If you fail to hire him to do so, expect the work to fail inspections and not be approved.  I have investigated many a building which had open permits which were never closed and work which was never completed.  And, if someone is hurt in your home or building due to illegal or incomplete work, expect those sections of the Building Code which deal with the need for Building Permits and C of O's to be thrown out you in the inevitable law suit which will follow.<br/><br/>Vincent A.

When setting a completion date I include ample leeway for legitimate surprises.  I ask the contractor how much time the job will take and then add to it, for example if he says it will take one week, I ask for a completion date of two weeks.  If you leave enough margin it is very hard for the contractor to say no, and if he does it is likely an indication that he has too much on his plate.  Contingencies can be included, for example, the job will be completed two weeks after delivery of the cabinets.  Doing this gives you good leverage if things start to fall apart."

If anything ever goes wrong in your home and you go to file a claim one of the first things they will ask is if you used a licensed contractor.

Donât do it, it can lead to huge problems down the road. Also you donât need a licensed architect for residential work, there are many qualified and experienced designers who can help you through the process as well.

I do find it interesting that the star of the original, Lindsay Lohan, overcame bullying and eventually found acceptance in the movie, but continues to be bullied and ridiculed in real life. Don't misunderstand me. She has made enough wrong choices in her life to sit on Trump's cabinet. But when you think about Robert Downey Jr. or (that hideous) Mel Gibson and the dozens of men who have made seemingly unforgivable mistakes in their lives only to be welcomed back and supported by the Hollywood community, and Lindsay as a woman continues to be the butt of jokes, derided, and not offered the same opportunities/helping hand/support, it makes me think society is not only a Mean Girl, but sexist to boot.

The main cast of the mean girls was bright white, though one was Jewish, but the supporting cast had every single type of person you could want: background, gender, ability.

3691,Arts&Leisure,"With Ms. Fey involved with both film and musical, this feels like itâs headed to being more in touch with reality than the classic film.  I felt this with Ms. Benjaminâs penetrating words in the stage musical of âLegally Blonde,â which depicted the Ivy League law school life Iâd actually experienced for three years with far more honest feeling than its very funny source film, while not missing any of the laughs along the way.  It could be the stage musical formâs potential to zero in on the human reaction (when the writers want that) in a way that a studio film comedy might not, since a great number might in its lyric highlight what might be just another event or exchange in a film, and I suspect it also has a lot to do with the talent involved.  Cheers to potentially topping a smash film!"
3692,National,"A message to all bullies. If you want a job where you can practice what you believe in and enjoy the most, and also carry a gun, join the police force"
3693,National,"""No gun was found at the scene. The department said it must have been lost in the immediate aftermath of the shooting, possibly taken by a bystander.""<br/><br/>Well, let's see: (1) if Weber had a gun at all, no one alleges any shots were fired; and (2) none of the officers quoted in this article claims to have ever actually SEEN this gun before or after they shot Weber.  Furthermore, why would a random stranger look at Weber's body and then inexplicably risk getting shot themselves by picking up the same gun in the presence of the same officers?<br/><br/>It goes without saying that the single most likely reason no gun was found is because Weber did not posses a gun.  The nation has seen video footage of officers PLANTING evidence like drugs or weapons to justify their actions, but I have yet to see a random civilian risk life and limb to snatch a weapon out from under the noses of police officers who just killed its previous owner.  It's just not plausible.  What IS plausible is that an unarmed black man was shot by police officers.  Maybe they can show they had a subjective fear for their lives, but they can't bolster that explanation with a weapon no one claims to have seen and which can't be produced after the fact.<br/><br/>Finally, I must have missed the part of the article where the police claim to have been aware of Weber's identity and gang affiliation at the time of the shooting.  If they only found out afterwards, it doesn't help explain their decision to shoot at the time."

That's a nice instrument he has there...

3719,Metropolitan,"Mr. Chandler got out of the meat grinder, good for him. This beautiful article made me think of the difference between composing music and playing it. The classical composers all took that step beyond memorizing and playing the music of others to write (or hear as Mr. Chandler put it) their own. This step is one I cannot make myself so all I can do is play the piano as a hobby. I see the difficulty and horror Mr. Chandler endured, not just memorizing and executing beautiful music but doing it for an audience to hear and judge one's performance. Ghastly. But if not for those orchestras we would not be the civilization that we are. "
3720,Metropolitan," We put too much weight on certain gifts such as the ability to play the violin. This was a story about a man with a life-Long passion for boats and the sea, who was also a successful actuary and apparently a family man.

3722,Metropolitan,"Another day, another beautiful NY Times piece. While most of us may never have Mr Chandlerâs natural talent, his choice to follow his heart and make what sounds like a fulfilling life is far more inspiring and relatable than hearing of a prodigyâs successes on stage. "

3726,Metropolitan,"I just have to point out how truly great the photograph is that accompanies this piece. Haunting and beautiful and conveys the blue mood that undoubtedly falls upon Mr. Chandler at times when he lets himself remember how some musical pieces made him feel when he once played them.<br/><br/>What an exceptionally beautiful story though showing how sometimes our talents are not always our passion and how an all-consuming pursuit of excellence in one area may not ultimately be fulfilling. Mr. Chandler appears to have known himself well enough at an early age to realize that near perfection was required to perform at the highest levels and that such a goal might demand so much from himself that there would be little left of the other parts that provide balance and roundness to the notes of life. <br/><br/>He must have been, and perhaps still is, a wonder, and it is surely a loss for the world, but then the world cannot demand what cannot be given, no matter how much the rest of us may love or need it. There is a time, a place, and a role for all of us, and Mr. Chandler appears to have found his place and role that made his time on earth meaningful for him. Would that we all could be so fortunate.<br/><br/>By the way, did I note what a truly great photograph that is? "

By his own account, he found himself the moment he quit playing the violin."

Or, perhaps win an award that comes with a prize that would have at least secured some sort of lifelong income/position.  As the article describes, it looks like he would have had a good chance of winning, and then he could have quit.  I won such an Award through the University:  The Student Award.  But, I didn't burn-out like he did... I like being On Campus helping Students and Professors.  I am a highly ranked ""Star"" Professor today.  All of those hours sitting in a K-12 Public School classroom, thus certainly not a cush one like in the K-12 Private Schools.  All of those hours doing my Homework.  --- I couldn't let all of that go away, be wasted.  I wouldn't.  But, I do wonder if I have a good enough voice to have a song on the radio someday.  I plan to ask Madonna, her opinion!  Maybe with some voice lessons.           "
3731,Metropolitan,"Mr Chandler is not alone. I abandoned my harp, having played in the same halls, having been a similar--if not as gifted--prodigy with a keen muscle memory and an ability to fall into that trance where technique takes over and you hear the music you are playing as a kind of inner voice, with no sense of the outside world,and you return only when the piece ends, to take a bow, to applause. I realized I was not a musician, I had no overarching interest in music, in theory, in learning more instruments. I was, in effect, a one girl circus. I moved on."
3732,Metropolitan,"Mr. Chandler's story could be retold thousands of times over with an ever-evolving cast of young musicians. We in the musical arts see it all the time. <br/><br/>Having a talent for something is not the same thing as having the temperament for it, and any artist must assess where he or she stands in that regard. <br/><br/>A challenge facing classical music instrumentalists are the astronomically high standards that have accrued during the past 400 years. And with recordings every aspiring violinist is compared not only with his contemporaries, but against the recordings of Heifetz, Oistrakh, Szigeti, Milstein, etc.  Most professions do not approach that level of stress and unrelenting labor.  "
3733,Metropolitan,"It's his parents who ruined music for him; all that unnecessary pressure. My mom ruined violin for me by applying too much pressure. Without practicing I could sight-read without mistakes during recitals at the age of eight. Despite that I taught myself how to read music again and how to sing and play guitar, keyboard, drums, and bass. Love is the only true course for geniality. I tell every new talent -- as I steal from Balzac -- that great talent is nothing without great willpower. And you'll never have the necessary willpower unless you play or do something you truly love. Vicariousness is selfish and malignant -- beware of any ""teacher"" who uses abstract and pedantic language to describe excellence in the arts. They're complete strangers to genius and the true courageous spirit of the artist. "

For every Shiffrin, 10 others never want to ski again.<br/><br/>Journalism usually samples the winners, the outliers. "
3737,Metropolitan,"Oh my I know him! I bought a boat from the yard where he hangs out. We went to get food a few times, chilled on the water. He was such a cool guy, u had no idea that he was a violinist though! Heâs been working on this big boat for a long time, and his son sold me the Catalina I bought at the yard. We were gonna go on an adventure to the Caribbean some day but it never worked out. How cool that the NYT published a story about him! "
3738,Metropolitan,"Such a sad and yet uplifting story.  I am glad that Mr. Chandler can still bring a violin to life.   Thank you for sharing this man's life story. <br/><br/>And to Mr. Perlman...anyone who takes violin as seriously as you have your entore life would not forget receiving an S and not an E.

I love music, and have often felt blessed to be on the other end of the talent spectrum from Mr. Chandler: music was never a career option for me.<br/><br/>But his story reminds me of someone I knew very casually in college back in the early 1980's. She was barely high school age and taking upper division and graduate courses in mathematics. She was friendly but quiet, received nearly perfect scores on the few of her tests I was able to eyeball when they were handed back.<br/><br/>Then one day she disappeared. I never saw her again. From time to time I Google her unusual name, but so far have found absolutely nothing. I've always wondered what happened to her. I hope she's doing okay. "
3744,Metropolitan,"Beautiful! This story breaks my heart - in a wonderful way.  All I have ever wanted is to play the piano beautifully, to be able to play ""Gaspard de la Nuit"" or Chopin's Barcarolle like a master.  I was never given lessons.  I play the cello (which I adore) passably, I had a good 40-year professional career on the French Horn. And in the end, music sustained - no, elevated me through all manner of grief and loss. I realize how fortunate I have been - even if my genetic disposition did not reveal genius.  My music-making was the same as Mr. Chandler's boat-building - it gave and continues to give me a fully-enriched life which in turn allows me to give in return.  He is to be admired and respected - he turned away the world's love to find his own."
3745,Metropolitan,"Juilliard was a very tough place.I knew many string players. Galamian was a legend, but there were many greats - one of the greats  and his story should be told is Felix Galimir, whom I knew, adored and loved, and his wife, Suzanne.  They were Viennese and spoke Ladino to each other. He taught a lot of the string players whom I knew (I am NOT a string player) and once made the MORTAL mistake of picking up a viola and asking whose violin it was - never thought I'd live that down - wish I realized that was not important but I was 19).  Felix Galimir would play for students, demonstrating tone and beauty and encourage them in ways to make laughter and music combine. Once, having lunch w/him in the cafeteria at Juilliard, I mentioned I had a ""vicarious"" experience. In his charming Viennese accent he quizzically asked me the meaning of ""vicarious"", which I earnestly explained..(19 years old). When I finished my definition of ""vicarious"" he leaned back, looked at me, eyes twinkling, and said ""Ah.. I have Neever had THAT kind of exPERience.""<br/>Turns out he did the crossword puzzle from the London Times every day, in some record time.<br/>He also was the violinist at one of Ravel's last recordings, I think.<br/>Juilliard could be brutal, but like all places, the best and most brilliant teachers are always humble and generous.<br/>A great story of one man's experience with his violin &amp; Galamian.  Thank you. "

3748,Metropolitan,"A wonderful story and a wonderful piece of writing. He made the right choice, obviously, in giving up music. For every Lang Lang, or for that matter, the Williams sister, there are many children and teens who do not want the pressure that comes with the endless hours to perform. This man appears at ease with his decision. The world needs more well-rounded people and not another talented but tormented violinist. One small point. Just as Jack Nicklaus remembers every tournament he has ever played I am betting Pearlman does indeed remember every competition he has been involved with."
3749,Metropolitan,"An amazing article, beautifully written.  Saul's reflections that ""Childhood was lost.  Time was lost"" is a great reminder to let kids and teenagers meander.

Itâs pretty cool, especially as someone whoâs interested in film and acting, to grow up in a place where movies are filmed. But it doesnât have the amazing scenery thatâs featured in movies like Star Wars or The Lord of the Rings trilogy, so sometimes itâs hard to appreciate the fact that movies were filmed here.<br/>Even though Wakanda is a fictional country, it was influenced by things in real African nations. The colors and scenery were so gorgeous and Iâd love to visit a place with such bustling culture and vibrant environments.

3765,Foreign,"Look at waves of sub-Saharan African migrants departing from Libya. My view is that the cause of all this, including the situation in Greece, is the sense of entitlement that the 1951 Refugee Convention bestows. The following is taken from Refugees Deeply who responded to the argument put forth below.<br/>The key challenge is to find a humane, legal way of reducing irregular economic migration. Ultimately, this can only be achieved by changing the incentives that currently exist for would-be economic migrants. Currently the only disincentives to traveling to Europe are the cost and the risk of the journey.<br/>The vast majority of migrants who make it to Italy can be confident that they will be able to stay, whether they are granted international protection or not. Last year 130,000 people applied for asylum in Italy, a majority from West African countries. The same year 12,000 applicants were granted international protection. But almost everybody stays in Europe, regardless of their asylum status.<br/>One obvious reason for this is the reluctance of countries of origin to cooperate in the identification and return of their citizens. In  In 2016 more than 100,000 people arrived in Italy from six West African nations; around 4,300 citizens of these countries were granted international protection. And 255 returned, voluntarily or by force. Successive Italian authorities have found it easiest to allow migrants to either move on to other European countries."

3772,Games,At least thatâs what I was told. What do I know? Maybe the guy at Home Depot was pulling my leg. <br/><br/>But my lawn has never looked better. 
3773,Weekend,"Alas, I have to respectfully disagree with this reviewer's (and most commenters') take. Something about this production just seemed to me off; it was as if the direction had rendered a complicated and beautiful play simplistic. The cast appeared to have been encouraged to play for the laughs (Metcalf, especially) and the tears, which overshadowed and detracted from the work's deep insight. I can't help but wonder the extent to which the Times' stamp of approval here is in fact a commendation of Glenda Jackson's commendable career."
3774,Weekend,"I went specifically to see Glenda Jackson, and she and the play exceeded expectations.   Like much Albee, the play is sometimes pretentious, often insightful, and always entertaining.  Three great performances.  <br/><br/>Thank you for including a link to Dame Glenda's devastating rebuke to tributes to Thatcher.   <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDtClJYJBj8"" title=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDtClJYJBj8"" target=""_blank"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDtClJYJBj8</a>   It's worth watching.<br/><br/>The same fiery passion she showed in the House of Commons is displayed on Broadway in service to the task of portraying a character that displays some of the narcissism of the Thatcherism she so articulately deplored.  Well done."
3775,Weekend,Glenda Jackson's performance was the best performance I've ever seen in my life...anywhere. 
3776,Weekend,"Saw it last week, also saw it at the Promenade Theater in 1994, a better production in my opinion. Marion Seldes as B was elegant and naughty and this time around the role fell flat.  Glenda Jackson was cranky without enjoying her crankiness.  This production seemed lacking in humor and somewhat cynical overall. But the set is superb."
3777,Weekend,Would it be worth a trip from Portland just to see?
3778,Weekend,Seems worth a trip to NY from California just to see this play. Love all three women. 
3779,Weekend,"I was privileged to see it.  We will be talking about Ms. Jackson, and for good reason, for a long time, but the transformation the set undergoes  underscores all of Albee's characters' transformations in an amazing and unforgettable way. It matches the best work of Mielziner and Ming Cho Lee--Mielziner especially."
3780,Weekend,"I have not seen a better production in years.  Jackson is phenomenal.  I feel for Metcalf and Pill having to balance out a performance of that strength and vigor, but they give it their all.  Incredible.  See it if you can!"
3781,Weekend,"If you canât get to New York (and boy do I wish I could) to see the play and want to see some very fine acting by Laurie Metcalf, I wholeheartedly recommend two series - Getting On and Horace and Pete.  She was amazing in both.  "
3782,Weekend,"GO SEE THIS! Really.<br/>Outstanding theatre- shocking, funny, beautiful staging , sets, costumes, pitch-perfect performances.<br/>Saw my first Albee in the 60s, downtown. Was astonished, so wrote him a fan letter, which I left at the stage door, I think.<br/>And he replied!<br/> 3 Tall women is the perfect tribute to this superb playwright.<br/>Thanks to you all.."
3783,Weekend,"Absolutely thrilling.  Jackson and Metcalf giving two of the season's finest performances.  Better than the original, which was pretty great.  Cudos to Joe Mantello!  Bought tickets to see it again immediately after our first viewing."
3784,Weekend,Can't wait to go see it!
3785,Weekend,"She's not a dame. Not sure they ever offered, given her strong socialist views, and not sure she'd accept if they did. "
3786,Weekend,"depends how important theater is to you-- do factor that this is likely a once in a lifetime opportunity to see Glenda Jackson on stage doing a piece worthy of her talents.  So, I say yes, it is worth it. But, don't go in expecting theatrical ""fireworks"", it is more quietly affecting and imposing, but brilliant nonetheless."
3787,Investigative,"I am sorry, but the cover of Mr. Pecker's glossy puff piece (The New Kingdom) inadvertently shows the Crown prince as somewhat of an off kilter Saudi Mickey Mouse. it is quite hilarious and I am sure Mohammed Bin Salman does not want be be a spokes model for an Arabic Disneyworld."

3790,Investigative,"Powerful men use their business connections to protect them. This dynamic has been going on for years. The Hollywood and media sex scandals weren't reported because the media had a sudden attack of conscious. They were reported because exposing Trump's hedonistic lyfestyle necessitated reporting on the same apparatus, and people quite frankly people, that protected other powerful men."
3791,Investigative,"When are people going to get the message, that the White House and the American political system, is not Trump tower. Truth be told, business deals are made by leaders of State all of the time. But, considering the morally decadent conduct at the man in charge, his motives, will always come into question.<br/><br/>Most regular folks donât get a mulligan by religious leaders and political pundits, for the things that Trump had bragged about and has been accused of. Yet, before our very eyes, Trump continues to operate with impunity, refusing to accept reason, from anyone who tries to reason with him, tolerating only those who self-grandise him with praise, as one would a monarch.<br/><br/>The only problem is, that this is the United States and our system of government doesnât allow for such folly. I guess they never taught civics, at the boarding school, Fred Trump chose to send, his precocious and troubled son Donald.Nor, was learning how legitimate government operates, was of any interest, to the billionaire wheeler dealer from Manhattan."
3792,Investigative,"I understand you're trying to 'get' Trump, but where's the smoking gun?  There was a time when a sterling editor wouldn't have allowed this to see the light of day until and unless you had something genuinely damning.  More gumshoe work is needed here, as any editor worth his salt would surely have said once upon a time. "
3793,Investigative,Now I understand why trump went to Saudi Arabia and did that ridiculous sword dance. He couldn't disappoint his cronies. Not to mention kicking a little business to Ivanka. 
3794,Investigative,"Is there any way to stop this all the corruption that this president is spearheading? So we have Pecker profiting off his history of doing favors for Trump, and Kushner trading confidential intelligence with the Saudi Arabian Prince for some financial favors in the future, we must assume. International politics is all about money for these people. <br/><br/>Yes, the press (especially the NY Times!) reveals to us all the shady business deals negotiated with Trump family influence. Thank the gods for the press. But is there any way to stop it. Can some law suit be launched to stop Pecker using his ""in"" with the president to make tons of money? Is there? Please tell me there is. Is it only in movies (made by corrupt people too, the Weinstien scandal has shown us) where the good guy wins?"
3795,Investigative,God I hate this administration.
3796,Investigative,"It is truly amazing.  Every day we get more news about how Mr. Trump is using the White House for his personal gains. And every day, the United States become less indistinguishable from third world countries, where the strong man at the top uses government resources at his disposal to enrich himself, his family, and his close friends.  Has US Congress gone to the dogs?"
3797,Investigative,"âA.M.I. has struggled financially.

Where does that money lead? "
3798,Investigative,This article makes me remember that campaign moment when Trump weirdly announced that Ted Cruz's dad was involved in the plot to kill JFK because of an Inquirer article.  You shield me from scandal and I'll legitimize your rag?  How far are we from Batboy for president?

3813,Business,"A calculated and shrewd business decision targeting a large sector of the American market that still watches TV the old-fashioned away. <br/><br/>While ABC went after the heartland, no doubt the other networks went for Hillary voters looking for commiseration and comedy by allowing increased jokes, coverage, and events mocking Trump.<br/><br/>The split in the American public reflects itself in the divided market, granting more power to the smaller subset of it by giving it a secure and untouchable (perhaps profitable) niche."
3814,Business,"Never watched her show in the old days; will not watch it now.  Of course, to be fair, I don't watch any network TV and precious little cable 'entertainment' programming.  <br/><br/>John Goodman has done good work in the intervening years, Barr not so much.<br/><br/>Just promise me that she will never sing the National Anthem again.  Barr did to it what Trump is doing to our once great republic."

And Tesla is hands down the best EV. My previous car was a Ford PHEV, the dealership didn't even keep them charged on the lot. They knew nothing of what they had and tried to steer me to different choices.<br/><br/>And that's where it seems to me this negative press is coming from. Traditional car makers see that they've lost the future and they're trying to mount a last ditch PR campaign against Tesla. But just go test drive one and tell me you don't believe the hype. "

As an armchair political junkie, I did watch nearly every presidential primary debate of both political parties; every campaign speech of both general election candidates; read domestic, economic, and foreign policy paper available (the Trump campaign had bullet points and no detail). I find anyone, even a comedy tv show, normalizing or justifying their support for Donald Trump not worth the anxiety given the reality of Trumpâs vengeful, vindictive, spiteful, incompetent, destructive, racist, and bigoted acts and words as president. There is nothing funny about Trump.<br/>Donald Trump did talk about jobs during his campaign but the real reasons many people voted for him were the negative emotions he sanctioned. Those who say they ignored (or did not notice) the anger, hate, racism because of Jobs! Jobs! Jobs! are in denial. They reveal the ease with which people can be manipulated because of their negative views, fears, and circumstances. Trump told them what they wanted to hear. They got the president they deserve, but all Americans suffer the consequences. "

3828,Washington,"China has a plan and that plan will make them the big winner in the Korea situation. There are four elements to their strategy:<br/>1.Diplomacy: China will be viewed by the world as a peacemaker. They will be seen as the single most potent force in Asia-Pacific. The meeting with North Korea is intended to signal to the world that they are in charge and the USA is a secondary player that follows their lead.<br/>2. Economics: China has put a wedge between South Korea and the US. Now they will reach out as part of any deal to make South Korea an economic partner in the world's fastest growing economic arena. Post-agreement North Korea and South Korea will have growing economic and perhaps even political ties to China's benefit and the detriment of the US.<br/>3.Militarily: North Korea will reduce its short-range nuclear  and conventional weapons aimed primarily at South Korea but with Chinese support will offer only ""incremental and reciprocal"" changes to intercontinental weapons aimed at the US. China will be more secure with the rogue nature of North Korea reined in while the US will continue to be stymied.<br/>4.Time: Time is on the side of the Chinese. In 10 years the Chinese economy will be the largest in the world. In another 10 years the US will be  second-tier and certainly not a player in Asia-Pacific.<br/>The US has no plan and we won't develop one without a fully functioning State Department/NSC and Presidential Team.<br/>This is truly American carnage and it will get worse."

3835,Weekend,this was one of the best books my son was given as a baby. we have loved it to death.
3836,Weekend,To find two of my favorite literary things brought together - the wise and warm Amy Bloom and hippos heroes George and Martha - brings me more joy than I couldâve imagined. I grew up with George and Martha as a child - and then grew up as an adult through Amyâs writing. This article thoroughly charmed and inspired me. 
3837,Weekend,I buy children's books for a library.  I love G &amp; M.  I think its time to check the collection and replace any that are damaged or lost.  Thanks for the reminder.
3838,Weekend,"Thanks for this insightful and well-deserved tribute. We got hooked on 'George and Martha' soon after the first volume was published, as our only child was born in '72. Now the grandchildren are in on the fun, and I keep my own copy of the anthology close at hand."
3839,Weekend,"Beautifully written and expresses a sentiment many of us share but have difficultly expressing ourselves. Timeless, gentle stories that any adult can appreciate. That the characters were named after the âWhoâs Afraid of...â protagonists is icing on the cake!"
3840,Climate,"Get ready for cancer rates to skyrocket, after years of declines."
3841,Climate,"I am beyond disgusted and distraught distraught at Trump's catering to special interests at the expense of average and poor Americans.Â Â  It'sÂ  touted that our economy is flourishing,  but whose? <br/><br/>The oil,Â  natural gas and coal barons have cornered the market on biggest earnings at the expense of Americans.Â Â Thanks to Congress' tax plan,Â  they received a 12% permanent corporate tax deduction and an individual tax reduction.Â Â  Who pays for America's upkeep now?Â Â  The working poor and middle class.<br/><br/>Our Federal lands are being leased to coal,Â fracking and mining firms,Â   which have well-documented histories of water pollution and land destruction.Â Â Trump wants to permit oour coastsÂ  regardless to harm to our fishing industry and food supply.<br/><br/>Now,Â  he wants to roll back air pollution controls.  Does anyone remember thr enormous number of childhood deaths due to pollution-caused asthma? Air that looked like fog? <br/><br/>The rich are doing well now,Â  as<br/>Trump follows coal baron Bob Murray's white paper presented to Trump on March 1, 2017,  (Link:  <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/01/09/climate/document-Murray-Energy-Action-Plan.html)"" title=""https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/01/09/climate/document-Murray-Energy-Action-Plan.html)"" target=""_blank"">https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/01/09/climate/document-Murray-E...</a>  to the letter. <br/><br/>But even the rich must eat and breathe. How do they plan to protect themselves from the damage their corporations do? <br/><br/>Trump and pals have  the U.S. on a no-win plan.   He,  and Republican cronies,  must be voted out. "
3842,Climate,"Serviceable electric cars have been available for over five years, yet they only comprise 1% of our vehicle fleet. For the good of all humanity, American consumers must be forced to accept EV's, regardless of their frivilous preference for gas guzzlers. Obama's 54.5 mpg CAFE standard was the velvet glove approach to force car manufacturers to make 25% of their new cars electric, hoping to nudge consumer acceptance up by limiting supply of carbon-fueled monstrosities. Trump wants to drop that approach<br/><br/>Isn't it about time to take the gloves off and just tell consumers ""You will no longer be allowed to buy a gas powered car after 2025"". Many countries have done this already...why need we be so circumspect?<br/><br/>Its high time for those deplorable plebeians to show the proper respect for their betters and bear their assigned burden...to save the planet.    "
3843,Climate,"I think we can agree that the Trump roll back is a move in the wrong direction and that Obama had the right goals in mind.  But I think it's important for consumers to know that 54.5 mpg is a fiction.  The loopholes in the Obama reform are huge.  And, what is represented as 54.5 mpg is grossly exaggerated.  The precise number, factoring in the loopholes, is not widely agreed upon.  But all estimates I have read are between 35 and 40 mpg.  The notion that average emissions in 2025 will be 54.5 is grossly misleading.  <br/><br/>Even when right-minded politicians go about improving the environment, they are not above deception.  Goals for carbon emissions are similarly distorted by the universal practice of using a starting date of 2005, which is entirely illogical and deceptive and results in the appearance of false accomplishments.  <br/><br/>If you profess vigilance on the environment, your source of information should be environmental science, not political cheerleaders.<br/><a href=""https://e360.yale.edu/features/on_fuel_economy_efforts_us_faces_elusive_target"" title=""https://e360.yale.edu/features/on_fuel_economy_efforts_us_faces_elusive_target"" target=""_blank"">https://e360.yale.edu/features/on_fuel_economy_efforts_us_faces_elusive_...</a> "
3844,Climate,"Yeah, it's looking more like once again Obama went way too far with zealous regulations and now big bad Trump will roll them back to more achievable standards and the NY Times will tut tut away with its hackneyed 'sky is falling' narrative. What does it care if an entire industry goes under because of arbitrarily high standards cooked up in a fantasy chamber? Let Michigan eat cake. <br/><br/>This is just like the farce with the Bears Ears Monument. Obama could have protected the relevant areas with a normal size park. Instead he ropes off a chunk of Utah the size of one of the East Coast states and says it can only be used for recreation. And so of course he created a backlash that undermined what he wanted to do. Of course the other party rolled that back.<br/><br/>By highlighting California as its ideal, this new faux progressivism is being exposed for what it really is: the affectations of the rich. California has some of the highest rates of inequality and poverty, basically by design. Because that's what the California system creates. It is about the worst place to be a middle-class person there is. Expensive everything that only the proud effete progressives can afford."
3845,Climate,"It should be well understood why the Trump administration is fighting state efforts to make cars cleaner and more energy efficient.<br/><br/>This aligns with Trumpâs decision to pull the US out of the Paris Agreement to address climate change.<br/><br/>As Senator John McCain said, âRussia is a gas station run by the mafia masquerading as a country.â<br/><br/>Russia benefits by climate change, and has stated as much. as they sit on a frozen tundra dependent on the sale of carbon-based fuels.<br/><br/>Further proof Trump is running the country to serve Putinâs interests."
3846,Climate,"This rule reversal will not achieve it's goal. <br/><br/>Automakers are not obligated to roll back their vehicles.

3851,Climate,With every headline or story lead I feel my pulse quickening and sadness for my grandson's future increasing. My meditations do provide relief then I realize the human race will perish needlessly. Ironic that on Good Friday the anti-Christ is striking again. Killing Mother Earth is one means of genocide.
3852,Climate,"What fools Trump and Pruitt are. Let's proceed with poisoning the environment even more than we are now simply to reverse something else Obama did as a step forward. We are quickly abdicating all leadership in the world, and as the major polluter of the planet, the rest of the world will soon not trust anything that comes out of Washington. These jokers need to be emasculated, and soon. November cannot come quickly enough."
3853,Climate,"I don't see how a fractured market would be advantageous to any car manufacturer.<br/>CAFE standards set averages over the entire fleet. More polluting vehicles can be sold in the middle of the country and less polluting ones on the coasts, with the standards still met.<br/>Of course, we would not even need anything like CAFE if we were willing to have a carbon tax, one that did not discriminate between industries (there is no reason to treat emissions from cars differently than emissions from other sources).<br/><br/>Our country is so screwed. Our industry is basically going to face huge changes in regulations every time the administration changes, making it impossible to plan and invest for the long-term."
3854,Climate,I wish the Environmental Protection Agency at least had the moral fortitude to rename itself.
3855,Climate,"It would have been useful if the Times had actually told readers exactly What rules might be relaxed.  and How that might affect air quality, How Much.<br/>Just lowering MPG targets for 2025?<br/>This article tells us almost nothing except ""we don;t like what they're doing""....even though we don't know what it is.  "
3856,Climate,"We recall back in the 60âs and 70âs when automakers were dragged kicking and screaming towards achieving safer, more fuel efficient cars â from the viewpoint of a corporate boardroom these âonerous regulationsâ naturally appeared to be unnecessary and unwise government interference in a successful capitalist enterprise.<br/><br/>With the perspective of hindsight, however, and the evolving tastes of the American consumer, itâs puzzling that auto executives would be in favor of these rollbacks.  While a case may certainly be made that these rollbacks may result in some short-term profit-taking, executives must realize that companies that choose to produce cleaner, more efficient cars will ultimately win the global marketplace."
3857,Climate,"This will create jobs - for pulmonary specialists, asthma ward equipment suppliers, and undertakers. "
3858,Climate,"If the Trump administration really wanted to help consumers and the automotive industry, a much more significant and bold move would be to work with European leaders and automakers to craft consistent vehicle standards. Not only in emissions and fuel economy but in crash and safety regulations as well. This would not only dramatically reduce costs for manufacturers by eliminating costly variations on the same vehicle, but it would open up much more choice to buyers on both sides of the Atlantic. There are a lot of excellent vehicles available in Europe that are not brought to our shores due to the cost to bring them into compliance. And the same goes for cars built in the US that are not sold in Europe. <br/><br/>But this would require vision and compromise. Two concepts that seem to be in short supply these days."
3859,Climate,"Where is Congress? I guess Republicans are going to continue twiddling their thumbs while Trump rules the country as if government is a business. Oh, how the Republicans howled when Obama signed executive orders because he finally gave up on Congress. The Democrats should be trying to introduce legislation - let the Republicans openly refuse to consider it."
3860,Climate,"This is a disgrace. We have smog in Phoenix from vehicles already. You can see it form over the valley every morning. You can breath it and know something is wrong. We have regular health warnings in the winter. Gas is very expensive already. Why are we going backwards on fuel efficiency and emissions standards? This decision seems to benefit only the petro/auto industry, at the expense of our health and wealth. Our current government undermines our nation at every turn. Their exit can't come soon enough. Yet another outrageously bad move by Traitor Trump. May he find a nice jail cell to live out his days. Lock Him Up!"
3861,Climate,"Mr. Pruit, my ""basic right to choose"" should include the choice of breathing clean air; letting manufacturers off the hook on designing clean, fuel efficient vehicles will adversely affect the health of all americans."
3862,Climate,Pruitt has always been funded and awarded by the oil industry. This situation in the US with going backwards in pushing fossil fuels is appearing to be some coordination with Rosneft oil. Just google it. 
3863,Climate,"Pruitt  even before his appointment to his position showed his hand. Working for and receiving monies from companies and suing on their behalf. Polluting as he goes. Instead of Make America great again, the big one will be "" Make America dirty, toxic, unbreathable, cancer ridden, and Undrinkable . My state has an absolute horrible situation due to coal ash ponds failing, owned by power company . Former govenor was employed by this company and instead of serving people helped power company, and yes he is a republican. Surprise ? I don't think so."

The data collected is streamed to labs all over the world in real time.<br/><br/>All well and good, but reducing emissions? I don't know--it's just so damn hard!! Drilling miles (perfectly straight and true) into ice in 50 below weather.....c'mon--that's child's play. But reducing emissions..? It's probably beyond human capability."

Why do organizations pushing scummy programs use women as spokespersons? Do they think it makes something murderous come across as less horrible? "
3869,Climate,"If I remember correctly the pending Obama modifications take aim at trucks. Cars are already very clean-burning, whereas trucks--and ""trucks"" is defined to include SUVs  and pickups, both main earners for the Detroit companies--are much less restricted, as any driver who has ever followed tractor-trailer belching black smoke knows."

3871,Climate,"I live in the UK and there are so many diesel cars the pollution is terrible.  The minute one exits the house or a vehicle the smell is overpowering.  Now they are adding fee after fee, where once the mis-informed government encouraged diesel cars, owed to the increased number of children with asthma and other respiratory conditions that this has engendered.  SO now we have the most idiotic non-policy in the US which will further pollute the air with devastating effect on individual health.  These people just do not care about anything but supporting their cronies who make money by shafting all Americans.  Sadly there is support in the poorer areas of the US for this foolish policy direction, if one could even call this full-scale rollback policy.  I pray we survive until these idiots are out of office.  Hope more Democrats are elected in the coming elections and the voters again have power in the US.  The educated voters that is."
3872,Climate,Happy Earth Day from your local GOP.
3873,Climate,Exactly how is this Environmental Protection?  The name of this agency has become meaningless.

3881,Climate,It's really sad what the US has become under this embarrasing excuse as a president.  
3882,Climate,"Pruitt is an enemy of the Environmental Protection Agency, of its original mission, and of the environment. Everything he and Trump are doing is for the benefit of Big Business, and to the detriment of EVERYBODYâs future. We will ALL have to deal with the consequences of what they are doing... humans, animals, and plants. But I know that won't stop them."
3883,Climate,We're going to bake alive on this planet as a result of these  senseless decisions. I suppose the ones orchestrating them will all be dead already when it happens. But don't they have grandkids? I can't even comprehend the pure maliciousness of it all. Anyone who doesn't vote in 2018 at this point is guilty of treason.
3884,Climate,"While the rest of the world is going green, the United States is going brown.  The rest of the world is aggressively pushing for electric cars, and many major powers have already passed legislation specifying the exact time of the death for petroleum automobiles in those countries.   Americans complain about the decline of industry in the US.  However we elected an administration that has made it its mission to make the US less competitive.China is going to be the clear winner in all of this. They at least can see the writing on the wall.   By the time Trump's sycophants realize what they have done, we will be a third rate power - backward, uneducated and irrelevant. "
3885,Climate,"Why stop there? When America was ""great,"" gasoline had lead in it. Maybe Scott Pruitt can have lead classified as a vegetable."
3886,Climate,"This might make it more difficult to sell American cars abroad, that the rest of the world already doesn't want.<br/><br/>It is bizarre that America's government is oblivious to market forces and keeps doubling down on yesteryear rather than investing is modern technology.  Save the VHS!"
3887,Climate,"The American auto industry except Tesla is running like cowards to Mr.Trump. Cars are too hard to make clean and efficient!

Yes, it causes permanent nerve damage in children.  So of course Trump blocked a ban of its use.  This administration has absolute contempt for the citizens of this country, who suffer actual physical harm because of the administration's actions.  Every one of their actions confirms this fact.   What an outrage!"

3896,Climate,"Went to look for a new crossover vehicle last weekend.  Didnât even consider an American-made car because of gas mileage and emissions.  Overall, The American cars simply didnât measure up to the top foreign brands.  Obviously people already arenât choosing to buy American.  The world is moving forward.  America was already way behind.  It will only get worse.  "
3897,Climate,"Our German car, here in Germany, is almost 30 years old.  We don't drive much, but our fuel efficiency is better than most of the rental cars we have used in the US in the last 10 years.  What?  They have been far more diligent here regarding the environment, maybe because we don't have so much room.  Yes, there have been mistakes, but the US needs to follow, not lead, in this regard. "
3898,Climate,We can still boycott any vehicle with really bad mileage and we will know it when we go to the pump to fill the gas   every 2 days or every weekend.<br/>We will need to empower consumer reports etc to provide us the data about cleaner air etc.<br/>We cannot forget the smog that used to clog our lungs in the CA roads just a decade ago and other places.<br/>Unfortunately even China now bans vehicles with bad mileage and air pollution data.
3899,Climate,"Once again DJT is proving to be not only stupid, but on the wrong side of history. These guidelines were 25 years in the making. Just look at Chinaâs cities with people having to walk around with face masks because of no restrictions on pollutants. Nothing here will make cars more affordable.  I WILL NOT BUY AMERICAN if this takes place. Pass it on. Vote with your pocketbook. "
3900,Climate,"Trump, Pruitt, Mulvaney Pence Ryan and the GOP need to go!"
3901,Climate,"It would be foolish to create 2 car markets, especially when the world is trending to cleaner emissions. Trumpâs reign wonât be long and a new President with an environmental agenda will be elected in just a few years. This is a costly and short-sighted move by the auto industry. "
3902,Climate,"Trump doesn't seem to recall that Obama had far more of a mandate to enact these rules than Trump has to repeal them. Oh yeah, that means admitting he doesn't walk on water with all of America worshiping his greatness."
3903,Climate,"Whatever President Obama did, Trump will undo it.  That's the mentality here, folks.  If Fox News applauds it, that's enough for Donald.  <br/><br/>What with all the added electronics features that you don't need, now with unimproved mileage and emissions controls, more reason than ever not to buy a new made in USA car or truck.  Check out the import models that will be mostly or all electric, or hybrids.  Progress is no longer an American product."
3904,Climate,Pruitt also rumored to be in negotiations to revive the whale oil industry. 
3905,Climate,"With Pruitt at its helm, the agency should be renamed the Environmental Destruction Agency. "
3906,Climate,"What isn't discussed in this piece is the effect this will have on vehicle ownership cost. At a cost of $50/barrel, the cost just in crude oil would top $600 billion. Presumably the prices paid by folks at the pump will be somewhat higher than that. Do you remember the last time Republicans raised taxes on American individuals by $600 billion? Remember, all of that money goes to an industry that (in the US) amounts to slightly less than 150,000 jobs. You can bet this decision is going to make some oil execs pretty happy ...<br/><br/>The flip side is that many car buyers actually seem to prefer more efficient cars and the overall market force seems to be pushing for low or zero emissions cars. Tesla wasn't founded because of regulations; they were founded to fill a highly desirable spot in the market for more efficient, yet more powerful cars. Similarly, Volvo didn't announce they were going all-electric in two years because of regulations; they did it because that's what the market wants. The economic cost of owning a gas car of any sort will simply be too great once the price of batteries drops just a bit lower - and that time isn't far off. Just like the dying coal industry, the petroleum market is on the way out due to market forces. When it comes down to it, what Americans want is to save money."
3907,Climate,"Something has gone strangely wrong in our country.  We fought for decades to reign in the auto-industry and their pollution machines - who can possibly support this move by the EPA except for big car makers - and their ONLY motivation is money, period.  We need to regain control fo our government, they are doing a lot of things while we all sit around complaining about Donald Trump's tweets, and little of it is good."
3908,Climate,"Then Trump complains that US cars and trucks aren't imported by other countries. Why? Because they're not fuel efficient. Without these requirements, Ford, GM and Chrysler keep producing vehicles that are only viable where gasoline is less than $4 a gallon -- namely, the US. In the short-run, this will be good for US automakers. Ten years from now, we won't have invested capital in electric vehicles, and foreign manufacturers will take the rest of the market share we haven't already given up. And don't even get me started on carbon emissions. Instead of leading the way in new technology, Trump wants to backpedal to carburetors and V8s rather than renewable energy and EVs &amp; hybrids. Just like steel, these jobs will be gone forever."
3909,Climate,Thank you. I made a comment- from a real American!
3910,Climate,no let them and their workers go under this time - let the auto workers get jobs at burger king
3911,Climate,You are in TX. How about we push our families and neighbors to look in smaller vehicles. 90% of the trucks never see dirt. Gas guzzling SUVs are not inherently safer. So safety is no excuse to buy a guzzler.<br/><br/>Only time my truck saw any dirt was in Big Bend. Funny part is there was more dirt on the road entering Terlingua than in the national park.

3918,Climate,"And the rubes keep buying those pickup trucks. Of course, they'll be hosed once gas goes back up to $4/gallon."
3919,Climate,"Well, let's expand the scope of your accusation by saying that every driver in the world is guilty of helping to kill the planet, and to be fair let's include every airline passenger on every flight as also helping to kill the planet. We, most likely, should include every user in the world that utilizes electrical power that is generated by non-renewable sources. Perhaps consumers of agricultural products and husbandry should also be included?"
3920,Climate,"Is it a Volkswagen? I wouldnât be too sure your car is as clean/efficient as you think.. even if youâre not driving VW, your car might have high miles per gallon but release other polluting emissions."
3921,Climate,That would let Trump's followers off the hook too easily.
3922,Climate,"Yet we breathe the same air, drink the same water and eat the same food (in fact, you likely have in your possession of fruit or vegetables from CA right now). In your myopic and, quite frankly selfish, view, you do not see that, in the end, we all pay the costs for this stupidity -- all of it. <br/><br/>""Special issues?"" This is rich with ignorance and indicates wasted effort on my part...nevertheless."
3923,Climate,So how do you propose to keep the increased pollution and its effects confined to Tennessee? Trump supporters are not only incredibly ignorant they are self-centered.

So California wine makers, wherever they are localed in this 1,000 mile long state, have to deal with the problem of taking ""ripeness"" out of their wines. Really.<br/><br/>This seems to be accomplished by either sacrificing virgins, or investing in piles of stainless steel equipment that looks more at home in an oil refinery. Virgins can now relax because we now have tractor trailor mounted ""mobile refining platforms"" that can be driven to the winery, and do whatever they do to bring down the suger levels.<br/><br/>Next time you open a $70 bottle of CA Pinot, try not to think about the fact that it came out of a glorified pool filter. Technically it's called reverse osmosis. If your Pinot cost $10-15, then the wine maker may have simply just added some water. <br/><br/>In the land of earthquakes, wildfires, mud slides, and landslides, and the ultimate horror, rain, perfecrt ripeness shoud be low on your list of priorities for California wine. If you want perfection, buy a Porsche, you'll save money too."

Served it with pan-fried haddock, grilled asparagus, and shell pasta with Parmigiano-Reggiano and whatever else Trader Joe's put in them.  The wine tasted well and set off each of these items.  With a Fred Hersch CD on, it was a delightful meal.<br/>But I'm still hard-pressed to find good descriptors for the flavor of the wine, maybe because it seemed so much of a whole."

It seems to be an article of faith that they have achieved a critical mass that prevents them from going the route of MySpace, i.e.: irrelevance and oblivion. But, why canât that happen? No one truly needs Facebook. People donât need to delete their accounts en masse to harm the company, they just have to stop paying attention to it and feeding it free content, i.e.: information about yourself. <br/><br/>I see Facebook as quite distinct from Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google.

Both have the goal of manipulating people to do something they would otherwise not have done on their own.  <br/><br/>Ad 1)  I fear that people will simply forget and willfully submit to being deceived over and over again.  Clearly, the investors also think so, otherwise Facebook would be a penny stock by now.<br/><br/>Ad 2)  That will depend on whether there will be effective regulation or not.  Again, I am not holding my breath.  After all, Facebook will sell its services to any political party, so Republicans and Democrats alike would not want to kill the goose that lays their golden (election) eggs.  <br/><br/>1984 was a fairy tale compared to what is going on right now.

3949,Foreign,"Mr. Corbyn is not an anti-Semite,  not even an accidental one. To understand why some people are calling him one, you have to get clear about the concepts of anti-Semitism and anti-Zionism.  The former has existed for thousands of years. It is defined as hatred of the Jewish people.  Even some Jews can be anti-Semites, although that is often accompanied by a personality disorder. Anti-Zionism, on the other hand, has existed only since the turn of the 20th century. It picked up social force after the 1967 war between Israel and the Arab states.<br/><br/>Winston Churchill was an anti-Semite but pro-Zionist. He wanted British Jews to emigrate to Palestine. Jeremy Corbyn is anti-Zionist in the tradition of the great Labour leader, Ernie Bevin, who as foreign secretary during the Labour government of 1945-1951 wanted to restrict Jewish refugees from emigrating to the British mandate in Palestine. He was concerned that they would displace the Palestinians who had been herders and farmers for hundreds of years.<br/><br/>Anti-Semitism might overlap to some extent with anti-Zionism among people, such as Adolf Hitler and Josef Goebbels, who want to exterminate all Jews."

Campaign donations should be done by responsible citizens out of their own pocket for honest causes, not businesses seeking to gain an edge over buying politicians. Capital gains taxes are required to ensure no one can ever lock money off shore to avoid taxes and still use it.<br/><br/>We have a fundamental problem when congressmen, senators and the like with their sub quarter million dollar salaries end up being worth tens of millions in a single term. This is corruption to its extreme. It needs to stop. This needs to be a bipartisan effort and the voters must punish the canidates at the ballot box by voting them out if they fail. Sadly, people like stability even if stability means corruption it seems since the same weasels are being voted in time and time again."

Joe Lieberman sold out the Democrats again and again.  Despite the occasional vote with the Democrats.<br/><br/>Andrew Cuomo is Joe Lieberman.

3986,Metropolitan,"The issue of what to do with these monuments is a complex one that deserves intelligent, balanced treatment that would have made for a terrific and important piece of writing.  Bellafonte notes, for example, that nearly 300,000 people tour the Green-Wood Cemetery where Sims is buried.  Consider the counterargument, that we have an incredible opportunity to provide historical information about Sims, and thereby reach great numbers of tourists, young and old, providing an educational experience that helps them to understand history, which in turn helps us sort out the present.  In this instance:  How has our longstanding drive to improve health legitimized all sorts of atrocities, and what do these atrocities (past and present) reveal about us and our values? <br/><br/>Everyone I talk to longs for objective, fact-based, multiple-perspective journalism and history, for informed writing that doesn't make such historically ignorant and inflammatory statements as ""the fatal white supremacist uprising.""  The more informed we are, the wiser the decisions we will make, the less hysterical, the less antagonistic we will become toward each other. This desire to rewrite or overwrite history to create a self-serving drama (on the left or the right) serves nobody's interests. It has always sold newspapers. "

3988,Metropolitan,"I would be interested to know whether any women applauding the removal of the statue have carried their principles one step further, and refused to partake of any of the medical advances his research enabled.<br/>[crickets]<br/>Not purely hypothetical. The question arose after WW II, when the Nazis, whose 'science was 99% rubbish, did leave behind meaningful research results on the effects of extreme cold on the human body. Could these data ethically be used? Yes, said some, so that the lives of the subjects were not lost entirely in vain; no, said others, to benefit would be to sanction.<br/>And in a few generations - perhaps within our lifetimes - statues of scientists who gained their knowledge by torturing and mutilatiing creatures of other species will take their place on the scrap heap.<br/>Till then, we can, like Falstaff vanquishing the unresisting corpse of Hotspur and claiming a reward for his cheap sham courage, we can vaunt our righteousness by venting our outrage on a hunk of rock or metal. Because we, of course, are the ne plus ultra of morality ... and will not live to hear what our descendants think of us.<br/>Seriously: Maybe leave the statue, and add one of a slave woman, with a plaque explaining the history. Maybe someone would actually stop to read it. No one knew, or cared, who these dead guys were until the protestors drew attention to them. Only the pigeons noticed them, till now."
3989,Metropolitan,"Amazing.  Just amazing,<br/><br/>I guess that the liberal Democrats have nothing to offer these days except scorn for important people in the past.

What a hoot.<br/><br/>So far as Sims -- given that the problem of the vaginal fistula is BIG in Africa where its a problem to get this surgery, Sims's  role in perfecting the procedure should not be dismissed so naively as your writer would put it.  <br/><br/>I have no idea as to when statues have served their purpose.. but sweeping history under the rug by obliterating images.. IMO is of no particular help... and the nonsense now about Columbus statues.

3993,Metropolitan,"Banning and burning books, tearing down statues are different forms of the same thing;  attempts to scrub the world of ideas and pretend society has arrived were it is by magic; that there was no progression human intellect and compassion. 100 years ago, Dr. Sims's professional colleagues thought so much of him they raised the money to erect this statue. 100 Years later we are so insecure in ourselves that the site of this statue must be expunged.  What we loose by making history invisible is the ability to learn from it; Dr Sims achieved great things and alleviated much human suffering. But he did it the wrong way. Ends do not justify means.<br/><br/>A statue that honored a great man 100 years and might have served to educate people today is destroyed. "
3994,Metropolitan,"Lets be clear here, no matter what you do say or think you cannot change the past. Yes maybe learn from it but even that seems impossible as we still have war, hunger etc.<br/>We can only change the future by decisions we make in the present.<br/>Turning our attention to horrors of the past do nothing but stimulate people to blame persons now for something they had nothing to do with.<br/>Let us all move on.<br/>R"
3995,Metropolitan,"The contemporary concepts of the injustices of chattel slavery and non-informed consent to surgical procedures have clouded over the medical contributions of Dr. Sims.  No one today would endorse either of these ideas, but the presence of recto-vaginal fistulas is also unacceptable. Undoubtedly another physician would have developed a surgical technique to repair them, but the fact that Sims, a South Carolinian, was a product of his times has led some to condemn him along with his procedure.<br/>Until the 20th century human surgery was barbaric and often fatal, but this did not stop surgeons from attempting to improve the conditions that so many people suffered died from or had to endure permanently.<br/>For those who are unfamiliar with the development of surgery I would recommend Lindsey Fitzharris's The Butchering Art, a recent popular history of Joseph Lister and the development of antiseptic surgery. Mention should also be made of William Halstead, M.D. who studied Lister's techniques and made the first antiseptic operating room at Bellvue Hospital in New York City. "
3996,Metropolitan,"It was fortunate that Sims is buried at Green-Wood, it made sense. I wonder though where his statue would have gone otherwise.<br/>My thanks to Green-Wood which has made the preservation of interesting and sometimes controversial art a cause to be admired. I am proud to be associated with it through family plots bought in the 19th century and that someday it will be my physical home forever.<br/>Those of you who have never visited the cemetery are missing one of the greatest art museums in New York."
3997,Metropolitan,"This article fails to inform the reader about the nature of the experimental surgeries Sims performed. I think the nature of what he did is more important than the inclusion of ""tweets"" by Letitia James which describe him as a serial torturer. Let the reader decide what to think, based on fact rather than inflammatory rhetoric.<br/><br/>Sims developed a surgery to repair vaginal fistulas which he perfected by operating on twelve enslaved women who already suffered from this hideous condition. A vaginal fistula develops when a woman has a difficult time giving birth and a hole is torn in her vagina. Depending on the location this hole results in a constant leakage of feces or urine. Imagine what it must be like to have an uncontrollable flow of feces or urine coming from your vagina. <br/><br/>The women Sims operated on had this condition. But he did not inflict it on them - they were already suffering, both from the condition of slavery which was inflicted on them by a society which violated their most fundamental rights as human beings, and through forced breeding. They had no say about the operation.<br/><br/>There has been quite a lot of coverage on alleviating the suffering of women in third world countries whose lives are still being shattered because they have vaginal fistulas. They are shunned, and their lives spin out of their control, because they have no access to the simple surgery that could save their lives. "
3998,Metropolitan,"The statue of James Marion Sims aside, there is a certain irony to the comments of a (presumably) Republicker lecturing the mayor of the city of New York on crime when crime is highest in red states that encourage every nut to runn around with a six shooter."
3999,Metropolitan,"Statues are not erected with the idea that we learn something. You can learn a whole lot more from that quaint pastime, reading a book. Statues are erected to let a society know who they should revere. There is no longer any reason for the likes of J. Marion Sims and Nathan Bedford Forrest to be shown this deference. What is needed is some compassion for the people these men abused, and respect for the feelings of their descendents."
4000,Metropolitan,"CA Meyer:  Perhaps these offensive statues, in that they are pieces of art, could be sold, or auctioned off, and the money they bring in could be donated to a charitable cause benefitting African Americans, who were victims of the people who are glorified in these statues?????  If someone wants to pay for such a statue, and display it in their private quarters, the money collected and spent to help the descendants of those who were once victims of the statue's subject, would be a kind of ""evening up""...a kind of apology.  I don't think that these statues of people who committed crimes against humanity belong in public places.  Personally, I don't think that they belong in this world at all."
4001,Metropolitan,"Finally, this is why we have museums. They belong there and not in open glorification. To have a statue to someone who dismissed the pain of black women is to honor those ideas. The question still lingers where are Dr. Sims white women patients? Lets answer that question. "
4002,Metropolitan,"Also, many free white women also had fistulas - why do you think he chose not to do his experiments on them?  Because he wasn't allowed to forcibly hold them down."
4003,Metropolitan,"I am so glad that this statue is being removed.  What Sims did is indefensible and sickening, and this is not just a victory, it's a sign that our society is slowly making progress. New York once felt that Sims was worthy of glorifying with a prominent bronze statue, today a majority of us can see that no one should have to walk by a statue of him on their way to work. I only wish the statue was being melted down so the bronze could be used for someone more worthy."

They can have a chance to redeem themselves in 2020 and maybe there will also be a personal benefit for them by voting this clown of a President out of office. "
4013,Politics,"Kind of hard to feel any sympathy for these farmers, if they did not understand who they were voting for then they maybe need to learn a hard lesson and pay attention next time. Voting based on a silly slogan on a red hat made in China has consequences my friends."
4014,Politics,Wouldnât it be great if there was a Party that represented farmers and labor? It could be called the Farmer-Labor Party. They could probably win a lot of elections.

The working class in Germany were the big support base for Hitler, but they were relatively well educated and look what happened. And like in today's US, businesses supported Hitler because he abolished trade unions, abolished the right to strike and basically made it so any worker who didn't accept what the boss wanted to pay them was an enemy of the state, in today's US Trump has made clear workers have no right to anything, that the government's role is to make the rich and businesses a lot of money.  I don't think people were duped, I think they voted for and still support Trump because he reflects the people they are; the volks in Nazi Germany really believed themselves uber menchen the way many Trump supporters are white supremacists, they like Fox Nation believed that Germany was the greatest country in the world and when WWI happened then the economic disaster of the 20's, it was not because Germany fought WWI, but because they were 'betrayed'; Trump tells white working class America the US is the greatest country in the world and they are suffering because ""they"" betrayed them. <br/><br/>The real problem is that Trump nation like their hero reacts, but doesn't think. And yes, the cult of ignorance is alive and well as well, these same people cheered Sarah Palin and her sneering at ""educated elites"" and the like. "

He doesn't care about much, but he cares what his base thinks, and he will find a way to make them happy.<br/>That is the opposite of what Democratic Centrists do. If the Democratic base opposes the policy of the Democratic Leadership, the leadership and their surrogates attack the base as immature and confused and unable to make the hard choices to get things done.<br/>Tell me, what is Clinton getting done?<br/>Absolutely nothing.<br/><br/>Have you ever heard a Republican say, we can't get tax cuts passed in this political climate? Do Republicans attack Trump's misogynist, white supremacist base? Did the Republican establishment over rule its own base to force Jeb! on them? Of course not. They know they need their base to win elections, that the two parties are supposed to take opposite positions and that to affect policy, they need to start with an extreme negotiating position, so they don't lose the compromise. <br/><br/>Meanwhile, the left base gets more done than the centrists, despite not holding office.<br/>They made ""inequality"" a real issue. They stopped the TPP (Trump would have never heard of it.) They forced the minimum wage up in many states and localities. They changed Wal-Mart's wages and benefits. They  forced Cuomo to ban fracking in NYS, etc.<br/> We don't need Blue Dog Dems who vote with Republicans, then lose the next election.<br/><br/>True power resides in the base."

4033,OpEd,"When trump picked up Mar a Lago it was a fire sale auction.So anxious to unload it, it sold for a pittance.That's how trump picked the property up and promptly announced he wanted to build McMansionettes on the grounds.Well the Palm Beach council, clutching pearls, flatly rescinded, reminding him it was a ""listed"" property not not a subdivision.<br/>So someone whispered in his ear that as a ""club"" he could have a little wiggle room to make money. <br/><br/>Needless to say, none of the tonier, stuffier establishments like Bath &amp; Tennis or the Everglades would let him in the back door, so a club for himself and his ilk was born.A place where demimondaines, gangsters and their Dolce&amp; Gabanna clad molls can wear their daytime diamonds and shriek loudly and maybe catch a glimpse of the appropriator.<br/>How fitting that a place clad in a thin veneer of  faux-gold paint so perfectly represents the thin veneer of his presidency."
4034,OpEd,"Why does Trump always seem to hold a press conference with other leaders standing right next to him. He rarely has a the traditional Trump alone at the podium, press unleashed. It seems he uses this strategy to temper the the process, formalize it. Also, why bring any PM to Mar-a-Lago, and then hold a press conference? Bush Jr. never brought leaders to his ranch? Obama, Reagan, Clinton, Carter, Bush Sr. never pulled these stunts. Perhaps Congress needs to pass a law about vacations spots, second houses and state business being conducted. "
4035,OpEd,"I think what it says is that many Trump voters were not motivated by ""economic anxiety""-they were angry that an Afican-American had the temerity to win the White House twice, and they voted for a manifestly unqualified racist because in their minds even the worst possible white candidate was better than p person of color in the Oval Office, no matter how qualified."

4037,Editorial,"This piece begins by citing Mr. Macron warning of the rising fascination with antidemocratic and âilliberalâ ideas, âthe deadly tendency which might lead our continent to the abyss, nationalism, giving up of freedom.â<br/><br/>It then goes on to compare the spread of parties across Europe that are against their country accepting immigrants and refugees in sizable numbers, or a campaign  against nongovernmental groups that help immigrants and refuges with Poland's assault on the judiciary and ""Russiaâs brazen violation of international norms"", such as the recent chemical assault in England.<br/><br/>However there is nothing in the concept of democracy, rule of law or international norms that says that a country must take in immigrants or refugees despite the fact that it does not provide a benefit for the accepting country. <br/><br/>So the idea that some people may not want their country to take in large numbers of people who have no intention of adapting to the culture and becoming part of the general society is not necessarily based on xenophobia.  It is based on the idea that a country should have an immigration policy that is based on what will benefit that country.  <br/><br/>The idea that a country has an obligation to help people immigrate to their country so that they can better their financial situation, or get away from the miserable situation that face back home, and by refusing to do so is acting against the ideals of freedom and democracy is absurd to the point of being ridiculous."
4038,Editorial,"Let US acknowledge that Macron, NOT the president of the United States, is the leader of the free world."
4039,Editorial,"I find it astonishing that we are witnessing what Mr. Macron and others warn about.  Of course, there are many factors in play here, but among them is a decreased appreciation and understanding of history, civic issues and  quest for knowledge.  Tribalism seems the order of the day. "
4040,Editorial,"Yeah, a rising nationalism that threatens to undermine Franco-German domination of the rest of Europe. Of course Macron would take issue with that. Merkel would probably like to, but Merkel is just barely clinging on to power. <br/><br/>Southern and Eastern Europe are getting tired of being told what's best for them by Brussels. Brussels is just a vehicle for France and Germany and having Brussels dictate to you what ought to do is why the British decided to leave. Britain is strong enough to be able to leave, the others are not individually strong enough to leave but collectively they can and indeed likely will impose their will on France and Germany unless some changes are made. I respect Macron and consider him an intelligent and capable leader, but he's swimming against the tide on this one.  "

4042,Editorial,"Interesting. These kinds of statements were targeted at the Irish, Italians, and others who immigrated here in the 1800's. Many of the same people who are now targeting current immigrants who come to the U.S. for the same reasons as they did.

4043,Editorial,"This is true and it was Obama and the Democratic Party's failure to prosecute any of the Bush-Cheney neo con war criminals; and to end the wars, when that is exactly what they were elected to do, that has ironically caused many to abandon the Democrats.  Obama's ""hope and change"" turned into the shameful distinction of longest wartime president in US history, having continued the Iraq and Afghanistan wars his entire 8 years.

4048,Magazine,"(1/3): During the early 90s, I served with a ground-level intelligence unit in the U.S. Army. It was an outfit comprised mainly of elite Airborne Ranger Infantrymen. Having worked alongside these men, I learned something that most people who never served in the armed services will comprehend: It takes a certain kind of individual to willingly volunteer for this type of work. <br/><br/>What I quickly discovered is that these highly-skilled infantrymen were wired differently than the average individual. To the casual observer, this mental disposition might appear as an almost insane hunger for euphoria driven by testosterone and fueled by adrenaline. I would go so far as to say it was a characteristic essential to their success and their survival.<br/><br/>We would routinely watch VHS copies of films like Full Metal Jacket, Reservoir Dogs and The Good, the Bad and the Ugly for entertainment. Clearly, there was a common thread of machismo that permeated our movie selections. For me and for many of these young men, I think Full Metal Jacket spoke to us in a way more intimate than certainly was intended by Kubrick himself. Sure, we were astute enough to understand that Full Metal Jacket was nothing less than an examination of the atrocities and dehumanization precipitated by war. Yet, there was an unspoken notion that we felt akin to the profound narrative arc of rebirth forged through ordeal."

4053,Magazine,"I agree with Jeffrey, who said that art imitates life:  I heard all of this and much more while going through Marine boot camp in the summer of 1969.  I lucked out and was never sent overseas, a fairly unusual situation for a four-year Marine.  I had volunteered for the Marines at age 17, as I wanted avionics (airborne electronics) instead of being a grunt, an infantryman, but I drank the cool-aid; I later volunteered to go as a door-gunner in helicopters, about the most insane thing one could do.  Like I said, though, I wasn't sent, and that's probably one reason I'm still alive.  But I read the ""Pentagon Papers"" later, which said not only did our governmental leaders lie, but everything they told us about the war was a CONSCIOUS lie.<br/><br/>In 2019, it will be 50 years since I went to boot camp.  For all that time, I've carried this hole in my soul that I was willing to kill another human being, not to defend family, friends or even country, but because of lying politicians who have this fantasy that the US should dominate the world.  <br/><br/>We've allowed the military and their political supporters to kill around the world, and they've used dumb kids like myself to do such.  Then, afterwards, they discard their trained killers--more than twice as many Vietnam vets have killed themselves after getting back than died during combat.  I'm sure many couldn't handle what they did at our ""leaders"" command.<br/><br/>I guess I'll get my final relief when I die.  I hope so.  It wasn't worth it."
4054,Magazine,"I wasn't thrilled when my son joined the Marines, but once he'd done so, I had no objection to the shouting and duress he'd voluntarily signed up for. If a nation is going to send young men into the extreme stresses of combat, soft training and a civilian mindset are likely to get them killed.<br/>I don't know if the extreme practices of USMC boot camp training are the best way to produce hardened combatants. Army elites appear to get the same result without the bullying. But recruits must somehow acquire mental and physical toughness far beyond the demands of ordinary life. "
4055,Magazine,"In my eyes also he turned those young kids into, lethal killing machines. In my mind, however, that's the same thing as turning them into monsters.

God didn't save anybody, the pilot of a well-engineered (maybe not well maintained!) aircraft did.  Perhaps those who rely on prayer in place of rational thought and action should not be afforded the benefits of modern technology?  "

4064,Investigative,"Ok I have to admit some enjoyment in this pop-corn worthy saga.  But beyond that it is deeply disturbing that ""news"" organizations (quotes intentional in the case of AMI) are doing the bidding of political friends and squashing stories.   Hopefully moving forward individuals will scrutinize such contracts more carefully.  Yes I know many are just out to make a quick buck, but sometimes their stories truly are newsworthy.    "
4065,Investigative,"People don't seem to comprehend that the importance here and with the Stormy Daniels story is NOT about any alleged affair by Trump 10 years ago.  No one on either side of the aisle cares about that.  Rather, it is newsworthy because of the recent efforts, in 2016, by Michael Cohen and the National Enquirer to stop stories about the affairs in the lead up to the campaign which involve, allegedly, white collar crimes by Michael Cohen, bank fraud, money laundering, tax fraud, campaign finance crimes.  There may be conspiracy charges against the National Enquirer with respect to this story which is likely why they now are going through with their part of the deal with McDougal and releasing her from the nondisclosure part.  "
4066,Investigative,Ms. McDougal thought she was just dealing with AMI and she would get a payment and publicity (fitness column) in the National Inquirer.  That promised end of the deal was not held up/removed.  The fact that Cohen was dealing in the background unknown to MacDougal is deceptive and the reason this settlement was probably reached.  How many more women were dealing with one party about payments/NDAa and did not have known of another Trump related party in the background pulling the strings?
4067,Investigative,"Beyond noting that a) the way these women dress is indistinguishable, and b) Stormy and MacDougall worked legally in this country, I'd add that a court case involving a coverup for the President by the President's lawyer and BFF publisher that got settled yesterday seems pretty current news to me.

4087,Express,"Respect and honor for Captain Shults. I was ashamed as a NYT subscriber, to see that early editions of the paper did not include anything about her in the articles about this incident. Tammie Jo Shults, you are an American heroine!"
4088,Express,Bravo Zulu Captain Shults!<br/><br/>As a fellow Navy Veteran I salute you!
4089,Express,"Funny..... My younger brother is an Airline Captain and had something similar happen to him.  He had an engine failure at 16,000 feet as he was climbing out after takeoff. With he and his First Officer pushing hard on the right rudder pedal he calmly let the passengers know what had happened. He then went to work setting the wounded aircraft up to bring it in knowing that it was extremely heavy for a landing. He told me later that he made the best landing of his career and when they changed aircraft everyone but one family reboarded.<br/> No press, no stories, no attaboys and no claims of heroism.<br/>I find it insulting to women that this pilot is getting so much attention for this and I would bet she is a bit embarrassed for so many accolades. Does the author really not believe a woman is capable? I assume that she can and she obviously has the love of flying in her blood to have worked hard at developing the skill to qualify and live through the extraordinarily complex job of flying an F-18 for the Navy. I definitely would tell her that she did an outstanding job and congratulate her on her career. I certainly am not surprised that she is a qualified pilot, her sex has nothing to do with that. The same people whining about equality are the first to write articles like this to let everyone know a woman did something a man wouldn't have been mentioned for doing.......that is sexist and I thought it was 2018 and we were over that."
4090,Express,"Wouldn't it be great if Southwest paid for Captain Shults to visit schools across the country and show American girls AND boys what a real hero looks like? And, that girls can fly Navy too."
4091,Express,Captain Shultz I'm guessing does not have nerves of steel.  She's a professional who has learned how to do her job reliably while her nerves were in spasm.  Thats the distinction.
4092,Express,"Capt Shults doesn't need our validation as a stellar pilot or as a female pilot. She's done the work to be superlative. She knows her metal. It is (some) of the rest of us that need to hear her story. Many still have deeply ingrained ideas about who gets access to opportunity and training. These folks have been naysayers, gatekeepers &amp; obstacles to opportunity, telling the world women can't do these jobs. In order to demonstrate skill under pressure, you first need the access and opportunity to do what Capt. Shults did both in the Navy and at Southwest. <br/><br/>I look forward to the day gender is moot and aviation has balanced gender ratios. Until then, someone like Shults is a role model for every young would-be female aviator who doesn't see a female pilot around every corner. So it's a big deal in that respect. It confirms that no pursuit can be justified as off-limits to women, which is necessary because girls still get a lot of pressure, direct and subtle, about what is socially acceptable to strive for. <br/><br/>I will celebrate Shults as a model for young women precisely because she shows them that they can succeed at jobs they have been historically discouraged from attempting. Every woman shown succeeding in a non-traditional endeavor is a catalyst for eliminating the cultural entry barriers to that job, until women &amp; men are equally accepted in the field. We see this in medicine, where there is overall parity, if not in every specialty. This wasn't true even a few decades ago."
4093,Express,"The rapid descent to an altitude below 8,000 ft., to restore breathable oxygen to the cabin, is textbook.   And it requires coordination with air traffic control, to make sure the airways below are clear.   Pilot training and response was textbook.  As was ATC's, I assume. <br/><br/>This story, however,  reflects a measure of journalistic inadequacy.   <br/><br/>The fact is that the engines came from one of two sources... GE or Rolls Royce.<br/>They are supposed to contain a catastrophic compressor failure.  This one didn't.<br/><br/>Thus far, you have heralded the pilot's training and professional response, and en-passant skewered the airline, when the liability here lies principally with the engine manufacturer.  <br/><br/>There will undoubtedly be a lot of duck and cover, as the lawyers position their firms for the wrongful death lawsuit to follow.  However, the Old Grey Lady can do better than this first report.  "
4094,Express,"I am always surprised when people are surprised at women's competence in situations like this.  I think of my parents, who were pretty traditional parents of the WWII generation.  But as to who would be the calm, steady one in a real crisis, it was always my mother, hands down!"
4095,Express,"She has my vote or support, if she chooses to run for office. We need more people like her on the âfront lines. "
4096,Express,"I believe the headlines in the NY Times stating that the aircraft ""plunged"" thousands of feet are incorrect and misleading. We have no information that it was out of control at any time. The pilot had to take the plane down rapidly to get below the level where humans can survive without supplemental oxygen (10,000 ft.). This effort would be done to save the passengers who might not be using the little yellow masks properly and, further, to avoid depleting the oxygen supply.<br/><br/>Elsewhere, I have seen the rate of descent listed as 3,000 ft. per minute and a knowledgable aviation source described this as a moderate rate. The passengers falsely assumed that they were in a catastrophic situation (as opposed to one that was potentially catastrophic) and that is easy to understand: the aircraft had been breached and might have pitched about wildly for a few moments after the explosion.<br/><br/>Please don't make this into another ""miracle on the Hudson"" mythology. Sure, it could have gone either way and there was great risk, but the aircraft proved to be entirely flyable in its condition.<br/><br/>Some estimates indicate that every person will face around 1,000 near death experiences in their life times. When we save ourselves from a car crash or getting rundown as a pedestrian, no one stands up and cheers. Congratulations to the pilots. The passengers have every right to be grateful, but this  was careful design engineering and the skill of the pilots doing what they are trained to do."
4097,Express,"Shults was cool partly because she was flying a Boeing 747. The best engineered passenger plane ever.<br/>If it ainât Boing, I ainât going. "
4098,Express,"In an emergency, the captain and co-pilot work in tandem in their attempt to save the aircraft and those aboard.  While great credit must go to the captain/chief pilot, what about the co-pilot?  Like âSullysâ Hudson River performance, I see no mention of the co-pilot or his/her role in the incident?"
4099,Express,I look forward to watching a movie on Captain Shults with my daughter.
4100,Express,"Now the big question, does she get paid the same as male pilots of similar experience?"
4101,Express,"I was a Navy air traffic controller from 85'-92' and remember the first time I talked to a female pilot. She was flying an AE-6 and I was so thrilled...especially since I was a 20 year old female! As a controller the ship I could go on was a carrier, but women weren't allowed on combatant ships then, so my career was automatically limited. Thanks to Capt. Shults who had the moxie and will to push us forward. And, I love that she looks like any mom the world might assume was the flight attendant. Let the stereotypes fall! "
4102,Express,"I would like to congrarulate the guy who stuck his back into the broken window to prevent total depressurisation.<br/>It takes incredible cool thinking, brains and physical and moral courage to do that.<br/>Pilots are trained to fly a plane on one engine; this is the first time I have heard of a passenger sticking his (or her) back into a broken window.  He can't have practised that in a sim.<br/>I'd give the highest medal to him.<br/>ALSO, I would manufacture window plugs that the staff can use to plug a window in such a situation so a person does not have to do it.<br/>I suppose the problem is that a window plug would take up space that could be used for perfume and brandy."
4103,Express,"Thank you NYT for reporting about this amazing person in an objective manner. Itâs refreshing that this pilotâs gender was not referred to in the title of the article, to start. A great story and well written."
4104,Express,God I wish she was President.
4105,Express,The good are always brave.
4106,Express,"In addition to Captain Shultz's professionalism, I would like to add that this is also a testament to Boeing and other manufacturers who now create large twin-engine aircraft that can continue to be controlled and safely landed even after losing an engine catastrophically (the GE/Safran engine notwithstanding)."
4107,Express,"Due respect to your brother, but this was more than just an engine failure. It's like saying this was just a story about a bird strike, which happens to many pilots as well:<br/>A Pilot Becomes a Hero Years in the Making <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/17/nyregion/17pilot.html"" title=""https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/17/nyregion/17pilot.html"" target=""_blank"">https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/17/nyregion/17pilot.html</a>"

4109,Express,"1) Both regional and major airlines are held to identical safety standards.<br/>2) 0 deaths since 2009<br/>3) If you want protect your kids, don't let them eat french fries."
4110,Express,"This article is about the pilot. I'm sure future articles will cover the engine when more info become available, which I'm sure will happen because there will be an NTSB investigation with a public report."
4111,Express,Word.
4112,Express,Why don't we know the name of that first officer.<br/>I believe Southwest is trying to make her into a hero so people do not notice that something went wrong on that plane.<br/>They know a story about a woman pilot would do that and that is why we do not know the name of the other pilot because that would take away from what she did.
4113,Express,"Thanks for those comments.  I knew a professor at Rice University who had a Ph.D. in Mathematics and in Engineering.  He contends that while mathematicians have to prove their theorems, engineers just have to show their ideas work.  A hero of mine is Sadi Carnot, a French military engineer around 1800 (the time of Nelson's sailing navy) who showed how steam engines work.  The rest, as they say, is history. "
4114,Express,"I know! And when it's a man, they always talk on and on about the co-pilot! Oh, wait."
4115,Express,"Thank You very much, Liz, for the correction.  Bob"
4116,Express,Good point.
4117,Express,"NO SEXISM. She did a great job as I noted in the beginning of my post.  But she had help, lots of help from lots of people - other women and some men. As others here have noted in their comments, I have great praise for the entire crew, ATC, ARFF and others. Captain Shults would be the first to extend credit to others.  Doing so does nothing to degrade her action yesterday and to assume otherwise is simply in error.."
4118,Express,"My impression was that more people voted FOR Hillary because she was a woman, not against her. Her loss was not because Americans didnât want a woman president, but because they didnât want (or not enough wanted) her. "
4119,Express,"There is no doubt that women are as capable as men, but it is incredibly sexist to suggest that as a gender women are more capable or possess skills that elude men.  Image the response to this comment if the gender usage was reversed and the superiority of men over women in handling emergencies was being proclaimed.   "
4120,Express,"Both pilots behaved with exemplary professionalism, but both situations involved high quality teamwork. Cheer for the pilot bringing in a plane under difficult conditions and also cheer for the other members of the team.<br/>It's tragic a woman died; it could have been much worse. "
4121,Express,Maybe because she was identified as an airline attendant. She was when I first heard or read the story although I'm not sure which it was.
4122,Express,Yes she does.  All pilots  are base on seniority.  She moved up the ranks base on when she was hired and there is no difference between Male and female. 
4123,Express,"The ""inept men"" are likely not inept at all.  They are greedy and good at actuarial mathematics.  Recall the Ford Pinto with the gas tank that exploded when the car was hit from behind.  Ford know about the problem and calculated that a recall and retrofit for all the Pintos on the road would cost more than paying damages to the injured or to their estates if they died.  This is what happens when government regulations designed to protect the public are morphed into being part of an evil plot to destroy capitalism and American jobs.  Far too many people in this country are led around by the nose by Fox, Brietbart, InfoWars and the rest of the bought and paid for ""news"" organizations that provide nothing more than plutocrat propaganda."
4124,OpEd,"Thank you for this op-ed, but I am not sure who it is for. People that are affected by personal stories already favor more compassionate immigration reform. Quite plainly U.S. politicians are (or should be) beholden to registered U.S. voters. If you want broader support for your position by elected leaders you need to make an extremely clear case why immigration reforms will help those voters. You touch on this only a little. You also ignore the many stories of H-1B visa abuse by disreputable staffing agencies that unavoidably color this issue. "
4125,OpEd,"""We have many qualified American employees who would love to be working in the specialized industries where immigrants are working but cannot because the job is occupied by those immigrants.""<br/>By definition of the H1B, this is at best a fantasy, at its basest, a lie."
4126,Washington,It's a negotiating tactic that Obama and Kerry never understood. Don't be over-optimistic or put too much faith in the process. Ultimately it's not about the process anyway but about the personalities involved. So far everything is going well. We should feel confident in Trump and not let petty partisanship get in the way. Trump is about to do what till now seemed impossible. If he succeeds Oslo will be begging to give him the Peace Prize and to restore its reputation after wasting it on Obama.

4133,Insider,"As an avid female angler, I'm excited by how much hashtags for women in the sport have changed this year alone. The new tag #lessskinmorefin sums it all up: it's becoming less acceptable to post photos of women in teeny bikinis (or less) holding up giant, suffering fish. But a quick comparison of #womenwhofish vs. #girlswhofish shows there is still a long way to go in the sexualization of women on the water. I was at a loss when I wanted to tag pics of the 10-year-old girls who won our local fishing derby last year. <br/><br/>I learned about #keepemwet from Heather Hodson of #unitedwomenonthefly â and we had a great giggle about the double entendre for women who fish when we met in person after several likes exchanged on Instagram. I've also made wonderful male fishing buddies IRL via Instagram and received great encouragement from male anglers on my posts â many of whom have opposite political views from me. I won't discount how much my gender identity plays a role in my likes, but it does make me feel more welcome in a sport that has been traditionally dominated by upper middle-class white men. I applaud #5050onthewater and also hope we can expand on that soon with less of a gender binary.<br/><br/>And I agree with the other commenters that Instagram is antithetical to the solitary raison-d'etre of our sport, but I think that when it opens doors for new generations and spreads awareness of conservation practices and policy, it's a net positive for all. (Terrible fishing pun intended.)"
4134,Insider,"A good article but if they are doing it wrong a very important thing that their maintenance of the fish is that it is so out of the water since with bare hands or without protection you will damage the protective layer of the fish since they can not live without That is because if you were to release them, they are apparently unharmed."
4135,Insider,"You're doing it wrong.<br/>Holding the fish like that out of the water, with bare hands, damages the fish's protective slimy coating. They cannot live without it. Even if released to swim away seemingly unharmed, those two fish will likely die.<br/>Please stop doing this and learn to fish properly."
4136,Insider,"The ""grip and grin hero shot"" is indeed on the rise.  For most serious and thoughtful anglers, though, it's pretty much an object of scorn."
4137,Insider,The poor fish. I have no doubt that many of them die as a result of this unwanted contact with humans. There's just no respect for nature anymore. 
4138,Insider,"Many in the angling community have mixed feelings about this phenomenon of posting pics. Fishing - fly or other - can be personal, a great way to bond with friends, or a way to get away from grid, or all of the above, etc. I was disappointed the first article didn't cover both sides of the debate, and then to publish another and not get into topics like conservation and the corresponding pressures that comes with posting is a disservice. To suggest that fishing is a great uniter in face of much politicization without mentioning current EPA policy shift, the fact that there is legislation in congress now, etc. is weak. <br/><br/>While I'd like to think that the social element can facilitate positive outcomes on topics like protecting resources - I'll hold judgment given the rest of what we're seeing.<br/><br/>Keep 'em wet<br/><a href=""https://www.keepemwet.org/"" title=""https://www.keepemwet.org/"" target=""_blank"">https://www.keepemwet.org/</a>"

I've been fishing for close to 50 years - first in the surf and then 43 years ago discovered fly fishing and the impossibly marvelous world of the mountain free stone streams of northern Pennsylvania - exactly where is a closely held secret.  Not anymore! Fly fishing has become a trendy, yuppified fashion show and now with the popularity of social media it's just another form of our egocentric culture's obsession with the selfie.  I will now concentrate my angling efforts on a species much closer to home - the renowned small mouthed bass and a couple of magnificent rivers just a step outside my front door that the yuppies haven't discovered and my fellow red-necks still can glory in the overwhelming beautify and peace of fishing in solitude. Tight lines!"

4144,National,"This bill, while noble in intention, would have had a slew of unintended consequences if enacted in current form. First of all, the threshold for 'frequent' transit service was a joke - 15 minute peak frequency is insanely infrequent - people will end up driving to reach their jobs, that by the way, are located nowhere near effective mass transit, with scads of free and plentiful parking such as you see in Silicon Valley. If anything, and this is also absurdly extreme, the state should financially penalize these jurisdictions that continue to add thousands of new jobs (no one complains about that, really) without adding sufficient housing, or provide financial incentives for those cities that rezone near true high-frequency mass transit to support high density housing AND jobs.   "
4145,National,"I'm disappointed in the title of this piece because it makes it sound like there are good arguments against it.  This is a good piece of legislation. It will address the housing crisis in an economically efficient way, and it will benefit people across all income brackets.<br/><br/>There are many reasons for the housing crisis, but the most infuriating is the artificial lack of supply.  Homeowners don't support legislation for more housing because doing so would limit the growth of their home values while blocking the pretty views from their houses.  Politicians who support this NIMBYism do so under the false pretense of focusing on low-income housing (when the number of new low-income units they want to build far trails new jobs in regions like San Francisco, and adding these units won't address the influx of new tech workers' housing needs).<br/><br/>Building housing near transit centers minimizes commute time, simplifies peoples' lives, conserves energy, and prioritizes development in an economically sensible way. Most importantly, it lowers the cost of housing for everyone. This bill wouldn't be divisive if there weren't selfish people involved."

Well, may be Forrest Gump is not the most articulate man about his thoughts and reflections, but he did, and he could reflect upon what he and what others around him (those who are valued in his life) experianced.

4170,Arts&Leisure,"If you asked fifty random people under twenty to identify Banderas, the number who could would be pitiful. He's right. Whatever his merits as an actor, which were most apparent decades ago under Almodovar, Banderas unfortunately will indeed be forgotten pretty fast after he's gone. "
4171,Arts&Leisure,"Lousy article, beautiful actor."
4172,Arts&Leisure,"This writer did a disservice to Mr. Banderas.  A thoughtful, talented man and actor, the writer seems more interested in his own opinions, like a teenage wannabe.<br/><br/>You deserve better, Mr. Banderas.  I look forward to watching Picasso.  "
4173,Arts&Leisure,Please. This is the New York Times. One emoji in an entire article is enough. It's not charming or trendy. It's lazy &amp; annoying. Just don't do it. 
4174,Arts&Leisure,I felt coming to America and doing American films kind of ruined Mr. Banderas. I can certainly understand the appeal and don't blame him for it -- but most of the vehicles he appeared in here have been beneath his abilities.
4175,Arts&Leisure,"Nice profile, thanks. One item left out: he was the only presence in ""Interview with the Vampire"" that brought the movie to life. Brad Pitt was young and just starting out, Tom Cruise was chewing the scenery, but the moment Banderas appeared on the screen, you got the sense of the depth and sensuality that film could have been had it been done right. When given the right material, Banderas has the talent, voice, presence etc to do remarkable work."
4176,Arts&Leisure,"People who stop at Antonio Banderas' physical attributes don't have the soul to see what lies behind those beautiful brown eyes â an actor of tremendous talent, a man of profound character and intellectual prowess. He makes his choices in life, and he lives with the consequences, which is a lot more than most men anywhere. Yes, I belong to the ""I'd leave my husband for Antonio"" crowd, not because of his smoldering sexuality, but because he is the kind of authentic man I'll always, always remember. "
4177,Arts&Leisure,"Mr. Banderas, <br/><br/>Much as Madonna was Evita, you are Che.  There is no other.  I will go to my grave with your singing the Rainbow Tour, High-Flying Adored, and the others.  That role, perhaps early-ish in your career, is unforgettable.  "

4181,Arts&Leisure,"When I was working at a large company 20 years ago, one of my colleagues (a British man who kept the entire lunch group of staid Germans nearly rolling on the floor with laughter) started calling one of the bosses ""Antonio Banderas"" because the boss was the absolute opposite of Banderas-style attraction, the epitome of female desire. One day my spouse and I were at an art gallery opening and the small, gray, timid boss was in the crowd. I knew that I would have to introduce my spouse to him, but the only name I could come up with was Antonio Banderas. To this day, I can never remember the name of that boss, and ""Antonio Banderas"" comes up whenever I think of him."

4185,Arts&Leisure,"Sometimes, the work of one's youth is so searing and indelible, that it becomes the greatest work of an actor, whether it is great or not in some objective sense of the word.<br/><br/>James Dean is Rebel Without a Cause whether one thinks that role, or his acting in it, is great or not. So it is with Banderas and his Almodovar period (to adopt the analogy to Picasso's color periods). I don't think Banderas will be better immortalized than in his roles in Women on the Verge and Law of Desire."

4201,SundayBusiness,"As a small business owner, I valued Corner Office.<br/>This was one of the least illuminating profiles I have read. "
4202,SundayBusiness,"I would like to see The Times do a series on how and why incompetent executives are rewarded for their failures with big exit payouts and then, like cockroaches, resurface somewhere else with a big title, excessive compensation and absolutely no remorse to begin their incompetence all over again.<br/><br/>I saw many people like this during my long executive career.  They covered their poor performance through smooth talking and relying on (and sometimes abusing) highly competent staff.  They were great at acting as if they were busy and overloaded with work.  If they also had good looks and dressed well, that was a plus for their survival.  They left top management or the board of directors with a feeling that the business was in good hands . . . until it wasnât.  By that time, untold numbers of employee lives were disrupted.<br/>They would then cash in their chits and depart for another venue, where they could make a new mess.<br/><br/>The fact that Ms. Mayer claims to be proud of her dismal tenure at Yahoo! tells me she is one of those people.  Why was she not asked if she is proud of what happened to so many of her employees and their families as she ran the company into the ground?"
4203,SundayBusiness,Yahoo's email went from bad to worse under her and no innovation occurred (she didn't bring the Google to Yahoo). At least Bradley Cooper has accomplishments to point to.
4204,SundayBusiness,"I don't know why people insist on tying her to her tenure as CEO at Yahoo.  Just because profitability got cut in half and she overpaid for Tumblr, doesn't mean her accomplishments should be overlooked.   She was also on the Board of Jawbone.   And Walmart managed to tread water while she was on the Board there.  She is much more than a Vogue spread that dated her boss at Google.   If not for her, the blue links on Google might have been green!   The horror!"
4205,SundayBusiness,"""Meet the new boss same as the old boss."""
4206,SundayBusiness,"Marissa Mayer, Carly Fiorina, and William Agee.  Three supposed geniuses with one failure after the other.  Guess having great PR is the ultimate executive tool."
4207,SundayBusiness,"It is difficult to understand the constant fawning attention Marissa Mayer receives from the press. Yes, she may have been a modestly competent manager of engineers at Google, but her tenure as CEO at Yahoo, an impossible turnaround job she demonstrably did not have the background or skills for, was an unmitigated disaster. Her description of the early days at Google and the founders' behavior makes the blood run cold. One sees confirmation in that of the numerous reports of her lack of empathy and people skills. In what work environment is screaming at your staff full time acceptable behavior? I makes one relieved to have never worked at Google or with Ms. Mayer."
4208,SundayBusiness,Mayer is the very definition of upward failure.
4209,SundayBusiness,If she is such a star then many... many... other start-ups would love to hire her. So far - none have. And yet again - the actual employment free-market speaks volumes.
4210,SundayBusiness,"Mayerâs comments about AliBaba are specious at best.  The only reason she kept her job as long as she did was that shareholders were placated by rising YHOO share prices - a share price propped up by (you guessed it) the escalating value of BABA. <br/><br/>Mayer made one disastrous hire after another, couldnât settle on a product strategy, and allowed a valuable franchise wither on the vine.  All while touting herself as a Google alumnus who truly âgotâ the internet.  <br/><br/>All she âgotâ was a Vogue cover and a 9-figure employment agreement for herself.  <br/><br/>Iâll be interested to see which VCs decide to find her next venture.  "
4211,SundayBusiness,"while i'm not a techie and rarely follow the ins and outs of shifting silicon valley politics &amp; personnel, i applauded her appointment. i stopped when i read that she banned yahoo employees from working from home and then set up a nursery for her own child next to her office. "
4212,SundayBusiness,"If there's a single figure from Dotcom Meltdown 2.0 who above all others has earned a terrible reputation--and the candidate list is longer than Sand Hill Road--it's Mayer. Her next ""act"" ought to be charity, humility, and silence, but it's unlikely she can fake those well enough to pull them off."
4213,SundayBusiness,"Planning her next act?<br/><br/>What a terrible record at Yahoo!<br/><br/>What's her next act?  To alienate an entire workforce at a different company, rather than just three quarters of it?<br/><br/>How many missteps at Yahoo! happened under her watch?<br/><br/>Please, stop the adulation."
4214,SundayBusiness,To me she was always like a pro athlete who was great on the team that drafted her because she was surrounded by other superstars( Google) but then when she signed as free agent to a team because she wanted to be the leader she failed miserably
4215,SundayBusiness,"Gosh, these business failures, they never go away, do they?"
4216,SundayBusiness,"Good grief, Yahoo was a company of endless potential that was ruined by ridiculously poor management conceptions and decisions.  That Marissa Mayer became absurdly wealthy at Yahoo has nothing to do with poor conceptions and decisions from the beginning."
4217,SundayBusiness,"The title is itself an indictment.  <br/><br/>She has a ""meet, not beat"" approach to compensation, unless, of course, it's her own.  In that event, she's more than happy to make bank while merely offsetting the declines in a decaying legacy business.  She is truly contemptible."
4218,SundayBusiness,"""A brilliant computer scientist""<br/><br/>where is the evidence for that?  Name the field she pioneered or made significant contributions in.<br/><br/>Mayer is a shining example of confusing luck for skill.  She happened to be in the right place at the right time and had the political skills to get herself into a leadership position at Google.  It's impossible to know if things would have turned out better at Google had the product decisions she made there had been different, we can't rerun the world and find out.  Google was on a roll and Melisssa was able to cover herself in the glory of their success.<br/><br/>But one thing is perfectly clear.  She took her skills, such as they may be, to Yahoo and was unable to make a go of it.    <br/><br/>I'm reminded of another CEO once touted as the next great thing, John Chambers of Cisco.  Chambers in the 90's was the genius that put Cisco in the front of the network world.  Yet look at Cisco the remaining 15+ years he ran the place, sinking into mediocrity.  Did he ""lose"" his touch, or did he never have it and his success was a matter of luck?  I'm betting on the latter for both him and Marissa."
4219,SundayBusiness,"Marissa Mayer is still here because she was compensated sufficiently to continue to do what she wants.  He tenure at Yahoo was a leadership failure, and anyone else would consider it a personal embarrassment.  As has been mentioned already, the shareholder gains under her tenure were due almost exclusively to investment decisions which preceded her.  What's to celebrate in her career?  The fact that she is renting the old Google space is telling - she really has no second act."
4220,SundayBusiness,"""To get the people who are really aligned with the mission, you want to make sure that theyâre fairly compensated, but not necessarily motivated by that compensation. I had a strategy of 'meet, not beat.' Itâs the trade-off between mercenaries and missionaries."" <br/><br/>Spoken like someone who earns 7-8 figures guaranteed every year. Gosh, do people really come to work JUST to make money to put food on the table? How mercenary!"
4221,SundayBusiness,"I actually respect Ms. Mayer's honesty in acknowledging that she could not save a ""decaying legacy business"".<br/><br/>I am not sure what anybody could have done to keep Yahoo as the primary destination for Internet users that was not tried - partner in search, partner with media talent etc. etc.<br/><br/>Most Internet companies realize today that users will basically spend very little time on their sites. Companies that are currently succeeding - like Google - are able to monetize these transitory visits. Yahoo was unable to do that, instead trying to regain its destination status.<br/><br/>Perhaps the biggest mistake Yahoo made was to decline Microsoft's offer."
4222,SundayBusiness,"Wow! Quite the soft ball interview. ""Her tenure was ferociously controversial. Investors did well during Ms. Mayerâs five years at the helm, seeing the value of their shares more than triple."" Really? You are going to let that analysis slide in a business piece? No mention of the fact the only reason the value of Yahoo shares ""tripled"" was because of the company's 2005 investment in the Chinese firm Alibaba a crucial decision which BTW was made by Yahoo leadership 7 years before Mayers joined the company.  So at the end of Mayers term at Yahoo and all the various efforts to recreate the company once you removed the Alibaba shares from Yahoo's valuation  what you were left with was almost universally considered to be ""essentially worthless"" or deserving of a negative valuation. This is an accomplishment? "
4223,SundayBusiness,"I dunno I always felt like Marissa Mayer got a bad wrap, I like yahoo I still use it, but the reality is no matter who they bought in a CEO it probably wasn't gonna be saved, it was never going to be as big again given the reality of its legacy, dominance of competitors, and the general war for talent in silicon valley where being in the next new startup or in the big Three is bound to draw or pay for the best engineers.  Sure she made a couple bad decisions here and there, but allot of good ones too. But in the end they righted the ship there, cleaned up some products, and got the company sold for a good price.  I mean I think in allot of other industries that would be considered a good tenor for a declining company.  It's only because we expect every tech company to change the world it seems like only average, when it was actually a pretty normal tenor."
4224,SundayBusiness,"Good article. However, lets not forget Mayer's paycheck was about $900,000 per week.<br/>Mayer may be a brilliant computer scientist, but I think she's an even more brilliant business woman who knew how to collect a big paycheck."
4225,SundayBusiness,"If returning Yahoo as the ""go to"" site on the internet was the goal, name one significant user facing change on Yahoo's site during Mayer's tenor to achieve that goal?<br/><br/>What I saw after she started ... the mail client UI was changed for the worse. Advertisements exploded rendering the UI difficult to use. And the front page because full of nothing but salacious click bait.<br/><br/>If it wasn't such a pain to change my personal e-mail address, I would have dumped Yahoo a long time ago."
4226,SundayBusiness,This.

4232,SundayBusiness,"Marissa Mayer was hired - specifically - to save a decaying business.  That was her job, and she failed at it.  Her ""acknowledgment"" is simply an admission that she was not up to the task she agreed to do."

4235,Magazine,"Well, I won't brag here about Indian practices. However, the truth is, the sages and Gurus always used to say and still continue to propagate this theory that promotes putting carbon back into the soil. And how? Just put animals back to the farms. That will do it. However, these days, we use fertilizers for higher yields than relying on animals. When did you guys last see the animals in farms in your country?"
4236,Magazine,New data and science was not included in this article that gives evidence that carbon farming can indeed help reverse global warming if adoption rates are continued. This project can be viewed at Drawdown.org.<br/>Also this science-based report has sparked a new certification initiative for carbon farming certification. It can be found at RegenOrganic.org.

4238,Magazine,"This is one of the breakthroughs that, in retrospect, seem obvious - like, how did we miss this?  When we think about the environmental changes our modern industrial societies have wrought, they're certainly greater than just the emission of atmosphere-transforming carbon gasses - it's the deforestation, the stripping of soils, the virtual removal of one of our planet's most miraculous and important processes. Science matters, and science strikes again, restoring hope as well as the soil."
4239,Magazine,"It's a paradigm that should find its way into every corner of our life, not just farming. Toensmeier - mentioned in the article - began his career by proving that you can easily create an abundant urban food-producing haven. Read his Paradise Lot: Two Plant Geeks, One Tenth of an Acre, and the Making of an Edible Garden Oasis in the City. Everyone with access to land can do this and the life rewards are enormous. Land teaches you, patiently and gently, if you are willing to listen. I started simply by growing sprouts organically in a sunny window - kale, daikon, black mustard seed, mung beans, red cabbage etc. That not only improved my health, it revolutionised my buying habits. I no longer had to buy greens. I had access to land so I planted some purple potatoes. That worked so well that I expanded to sunchokes, those incorrigible never-say-die American plants. I wasn't especially in love with the flavour but then I found that they make the most delicious flour. Add 1/3 sunchoke flour to any other flour, even flat and uninteresting ones like rice, and you suddenly can make the most flavoursome flatbreads imaginable. I started either composting all my food waste or feeding it to a small worm farm which has somehow survived snow, drought and neglect for many years now. After this I started on strawberries and rhubarb, caigua and tomatoes, broad beans and globe artichokes... And the earth kept teaching me. Life grows richer and richer. "
4240,Magazine,"""whereas manure alone can release nitrogen as nitrous oxide, the nitrogen in compost becomes locked up in complex molecules""<br/><br/>Huh? For the nitrogen in compost to become plant available and contribute to plant growth and carbon sequestration, it must be mineralized. Nitrous oxide is a byproduct of nitrfication (and denitrification), which occurs whether the nitrogen comes from manure or compost.<br/><br/>And you would most likely see the same amount of plant growth and carbon sequestration if you used any nitrogen fertilizer to improve production. Compost isn't magic."

As if ""the proof of the pudding is in the peer-reviewed research of said pudding.""  The anecdotal evidence alone is enough to prove the correlation between soil carbon and crop yield, drought resistance, improved soil structure, improved water infiltration, decreased erosion, higher profits, etc.; but in this case there IS peer-reviewed research too.  "
4242,Magazine,Yes you are sexist. I know men who wouldn't set foot on such a lawn either. But in California we're leading the way getting rid of our lawns for drought tolerant plants.
4243,Magazine, There are many natural products out there that accomplish this! You don't need to be put off by utilizing manure.
4244,Magazine,"Obviously rescued food that could be used to feed others would be far better used in that way. My point is that composting of food waste puts it to a helpful use, even if not the most helpful use. Food waste being sent to and rotting in a landfill seems like a total loss, of all the energy, water, and sunlight that went into creating that food (all of which Iâd consider to be of God). Compost brings these life-based and life-giving elements back into the soil, helping new plants to grow as this article describes."
4245,Magazine,"The unfortunate aspects of expert-led mandated projects like the WPA is that these nearly always fail. An Americanized Great Leap Forward isn't the answer. What this article shows is the power of human ingenuity working out problems that are local which then get adopted out of self-interest. On a national level, it is Federalism that allows state experimentation which should be encouraged, not dictated by regulations based on expert guidance.  If good ideas emerge people will adopt them. The biggest good-intentioned ecological and other messes we face today were those pushed by governmental experts. "
4246,Magazine,"Warming global temperatures is not the only consequence of rising CO2. Changes in the atmosphere can lead to more/stronger natural disasters, floods, and more *volatile*, fluctuating temperatures. <br/><br/>On average, the world is warming, and years as a whole are getting warmer, but rising greenhouse gases can also cause *colder* temperatures at weird times. In recent years New York has had both 60 degrees Fahrenheit on Christmas Eve and snowstorms in October and March, both of which used to be uncommon occurrences. <br/><br/>Thanks! Have a great day. "

4249,Magazine,"The Snoo, like a breast pump, is not necessary to care for an infant. Itâs the isolating, overworked, capitalist society we live in, a society that rewards economic productivity and devalues care work, that makes these things necessary. Parents living in a supportive community, where many friends and relatives are available to help with the work of soothing the child and caring for the new parents, do not need such technological devices. They are only necessary once modern society has isolated us all in our little houses and left us to fend for ourselves and our children alone. I never realized how screwed up our culture is until I had a baby."

Those promoting penicillin did not have a profit motive. Just saying. "
4253,Magazine,I am going to try this. What kind of solid food? I think the swaddle is the creation of hospitals to prevent liability issues and Harvey Karp is a part of it. Obviously restraining a baby prevents their development. Newborns need to use their muscles.

This treaty will dramatically reduce the ongoing tensions on the Peninsula and could one day lead to a permenant peace in Korea.   <br/><br/>So regardless of how I feel about President Trump, if he can somehow begin the process towards peace negotiations with the leaders of North and South Korea and with China, then I will be personally very grateful.  The future of my home and the lives of myself and everyone that I know and love dearly are all at stake in whatever comes out of these efforts. <br/><br/>"

4262,National,"It seems clear to me that the barista should not have called 911 for this incident. However, I suspect that she was simply following written company policies.<br/><br/>When the police arrived, the three officers clearly possessed discretion to handle and diffuse the situation. They had a bunch of alternatives, including the following: they could have removed the patrons from the store and simply sent the gentleman on their way; they could have removed the patrons and given them citations (much like a parking or traffic citation); or they could elect the most drastic alternative, which is handcuffing the patrons and taking them to jail.<br/><br/>Frankly, I suggest another alternative: that one of the officers pay for a three dollar cup of coffee and give it to the gentleman.<br/><br/>I, for one, am pleased that other patrons videotaped the incident so that all of us can see what happened and hopefully, learn from the incident."
4263,National,"I can't imagine a Starbucks in my neighborhood doing this.  Why, because there is more diversity and more educated clientele and workers.  So many people camp out at the Palo Alto Starbucks that it is hard to find a seat.  There if you were not homeless looking, if you asked for the bathroom key they would gladly give it to you.  I am proud of the San Fran Peninsula and our diversity.  Sounds like PA needs to hire more diverse employees and managers.  I don't blame Starbucks as the CEO is being very proactive after this incident. I blame the manager, who should be fired, and the neighborhood. Curious, did this neighborhood vote for Trump? "

There was usually more than one person involved in the thefts <br/><br/>There was a story a few years ago about Serena Williams having her phone snatched from the table in a coffee shop where she had placed it.

All these cities have serious problems with racial disparities in poverty, opportunity, and police bias.  Economic disparity in Philadelphia is, indeed, terrible (generally true for the other cities, too).  But having lived in Center City Philadelphia for the last 11 years, my personal experiences interacting with people of different races, and others I've observed, have seemed far less charged than they were in Boston (the worst in my experience), and the other cities.  The Philly suburbs actually exhibited much greater racial tension than what I've seen in the City.  I lived on the Main Line for 8 years before moving into town, and don't miss it one bit, partly for that reason.  Mine has been a very different experience to yours, Penningtonia."

I will never forget ""rhymes with witch;"" a newspaper interview in which she  demeaned Eleanor Roosevelt by saying that growing up her family disliked her (something to that effect and didn't counter it); her remarks during Katrina. First Mother? I'm a citizen and don't feel that way. "

She will be missed not just by the country but the world.

She was an icon of strength with civility that would be most welcome in today's dysfunctional government and life in general.<br/>I voted for 41 and had marked political differences with 43, but I never questioned their honesty or civility.<br/>Barbara Bush's legacy is her literacy initiative. She understood that to be an whole person and a valuable citizen, education is critical. We have digressed from that to an unprecedented low in America, the poster boy of which is The Dotard. His minion, Betsy DeVos, would do well to learn more about Barbara Bush and her legacy for she is steadily destroying what this great woman has accomplished, as is her boss."

Mrs. Bush gave us a riveting glimpse of China behind the Bamboo Curtain.  Thank you, Mrs. Bush."

4280,Obits,"Mrs. Bush was at her most candid when she said she was surprised her eldest child was 'elected' president, thinking the younger, brighter one would get there first. She was quite a matriarchal force in that patriarchy. May she rest in peace and may we be done with hereditary presidencies."
4281,Obits,"Hard-headed, hard-hearted, with a helmet for a haircut, and with no credentials other than she gave birth and was really really rich - she epitomized the kind of republican woman I dislike. Bye, Barbara Bush, I hope we learn compassion from your lack."
4282,Obits,"When she came to speak at the alma mater we shared (Smith), I was a skeptical teenager who had been taught to ignore and dislike whatever any member of the Bush family had to say.  In spite of myself, Mrs. Bush won me over with a speech I found much more inspirational than I had expected, and she herself was as gregarious and charming among the young students as anyone could have been.  After that day, I supported most everything she did, and I found a lot that I could lean on years later that as I balanced my life as a mother first, ambition second- which is pretty antithetical to what we learned at Smith in the 90s.  Yes, some of the things she said in her later years were tone deaf in nature, but since I also grew up in Rye, I can't say they were too far off from what anyone who grows up in Westchester County might hear.  I truly admired her, and I wish the Bush family nothing but loving thoughts as they mourn what is undoubtedly an enormous loss.  "

4287,Obits,She had what is sorely missing these days in our leaders: Class.
4288,Obits,"Why does the NYT continue to promulgate the pieced, out of context, and therefore completely incorrect quote from the Astrodome.  Mrs. Bush began her comments noting that it was sad that the people from the 9th Ward considered the Astrodome to be an upgrade from their day-to-day existence, a view which liberal politicians were loathe to admit at the time, given the billions of dollars wasted by Nagin with nothing to show for it, but is now well documented.  She then went on to say they appeared to be doing well, all things considered. And of course Mrs. Bush spent an incredible amount of time assisting and talking to people in the Astrodome, something the Times reporters at the time did not do.  So the Times perpetuates their horrendous reporting at the time, and does not even mention what an 80 year old women was doing there.  "
4289,Obits,"What's with this near-deification of Barbara Bush that I see in the media? It's hard to forget some of the things she said (about Katrina refugees and Geraldine Ferraro)...and the less-than-lovely Bush Boys didn't come from a vacuum. Or does the New Standard of Vileness make saints of those who came before?

4291,Obits,"I am sorry for this loss for the Bush family and the country.  I know she embodied a lot of goodness as a mother/grandmother and her strong advocacy of literacy causes is commendable.<br/><br/>Lest we forget her insensitive comments about Hurricane Katrina victims as mostly underprivileged anyway, so living in the Astrodome isn't so bad.  Also she made statements about wasting her beautiful mind thinking about fallen soldiers returning from Iraq.  If these were said in public, can you imagine what she said privately and thought about?  Can anyone imagine Michelle Obama thinking or saying such things?<br/><br/>Lastly, if she was so strong, astute and patriotic as many of the tributes read, she should have put country over family and never let someone as unfit as her eldest son run for president (btw, while I disagree with his politics, her 2nd eldest son was/is fit to be president).    "
4292,Obits,"Barbara Bush changed the world for thousands of people.  She did not do it through politics or religion.  She did it by working to help adults learn to read and write and have advantages they would never have otherwise.<br/>If there is any memorial for her, it should be first and foremost this.  To save one person is to save the world, and saving them from a life of ignorance has to be the highest calling.<br/>(glass raised)  To Mrs. Bush!"
4293,Obits,"Whether you agreed with Bush politics or not, Barbara Bush deserves much praise for succeeding in all realms of life. She was a loving spouse, a strong, devoted mother, a patriotic American, a First Lady who led as a role model, and a formidable matriarch of a political dynasty. Mrs. Bush was a truly self actualized person who represented the best of the Greatest Generation. May she rest in peace and may her family find comfort in their memories of her at this sad time."
4294,Obits,NORMALLY WHEN ONE IS CAUGHT BETWEEN TWO BUSHES LIFE IS UNCOMFORTABLE BUT HERE IT WAS A PLEAURE FOR HER FIRST BEING THE FIRST LADY IN WHITE HOUSE AND SECOND AS MOTHER OF THE SON PRESIDENT .<br/>SHE AVOIDED CONTROVERSIES AND WAS A CLEAR HEART COMPASSIONATE LADY .WHO WOULD OTHERWISE TAKE UP TEACHING CHILDREN .<br/>SHE LIVED A RICH LIFE AND ENRICHED THE NATION BY HER CONTRIBUTIONS<br/>MAY HER SOUL REST IN PEACE  
4295,Obits,"Rest in Peace Mrs. Bush, and thank you."
4296,Obits,"I think her comments about ""the disadvantaged"" New Orleans people after Katrina were meant with a sentiment that many of the displaced people had a hard life, but still endured, and would endure the Katrina catastrophe as well.  I think she was in awe of their true grit in life.  She didn't mean it in a demeaning way. <br/><br/>The picture with Barbara holding a book, and listening to children reading in the elementary school, reminded me of her President son George, sitting in a similar 4th grade class to encourage reading, probably thinking that he was happy carrying on with this mother's inspiring work, when the planes struck.  He'll have his mother's legacy to create new inspiration in himself now to carry on her good works.<br/><br/>Barbara Bush's lament about feeling inadequate watching the women's movement, could be shared by all of us at some time in our lives.  Similarly, Schindler in the movie Schindler's List, laments that he wishes he had done more to save more people and children from the Holocaust.  This is certainly a lesson for the living today.   Barbara Bush, I think, was trying to tell others not to have regret or lament at the end of life about what we could have done to improve other peoples lives.  Certainly, Mrs. Bush did a great deal to help others in her life."
4297,Obits,"Barbara Bush was a champion of adult literacy.  I'm proud to have known and worked with her on this still important cause in our nation. What an amazing woman, a moderate Republican who embraced Democrats and those of other political persuasion.  She was active in adult literacy to the end. I met her when she and the President, then Vice President, lived in the V.P.'s mansion in Washington.  She was a friend of Harold McGraw, Jr., who funded the founding of the Business Council for Effective Literacy and the Council for Advancement of Adult literacy, where I was fortunate enough to serve as operating head. In fact Harold once told me that he became engaged in adult literacy because of his friendship with Barbara.  I last saw her at a luncheon of literacy leaders held in her honor in Houston two years ago. She was agile, witty and good humored, and inspiring as the keynote speaker. She loved pearls; we presented her with a new strand that day.  My heart goes out to the President.I know he suffers her loss deeply, as does her entire family.  The nation has lost a dedicated warrior. Her heart was filled with kindness and her actions were filled with generosity, caring, love, humility, and integrity. I am deeply honored to have known her. This world will be a lesser place without her, but the lives of those who have known Barbara and who have benefited from her leadership and example are richer indeed. Rest in peace, great Lady!  You will be deeply missed!"
4298,Obits,"Fare thee well Barbara (and sadly Iâm sure George too soon, as these things go). You all were not my ideal political family but you sure came close.  You reflected the best of most of us, and you were normal Americans, so unlike the freakish creatures now inhabiting the White House."
4299,Obits,"My parents had the great honor of being guests Bush guests at Kennebunkport....they will always remember that trip.  Kind, gracious and down-to-earth weâre the adjectives - Barbara Bush embodied the best of America."
4300,Obits,"Condolences, love and respect to the Bush family from mine."
4301,Obits,Whatâs with American always portrait First Lady as if the queen being support of the king.  Isnât this kind of mentality result seeing woman being the support role rather than a leader? 
4302,Obits,"Barbara Bush had brains, spine and class, and that is an example we'd like more to follow. And for all of it, she was both liked and respected. What better way is there to leave life, than to leave it with people wishing for more time with you, and more people like you?"
4303,Obits,This does not merit a headline. Her literacy campaign is a joke if you compare it to the efforts to almost unknown women activists for the same cause. There was no real merit beyond being born and having died rich and well-connected.
4304,Obits,Great Obit. Interesting woman.
4305,Obits,One of Donnie Radcliffe's favorites at The Washington Post.  Rest in peace.
4306,Obits,"This is probably not the appropriate time to make this observation, but in today's political atmosphere, it's almost impossible not to.  Barbara Bush brought to the country and the White House all the qualities that are so sorely lacking. Grace. Class. Decency. Dignity. And most important, Honesty."
4307,Obits,"Why such fuss? This is the death of a gracious but not unusual woman--not Indira Gandhi, Golda Meir, Winnie Mandela, or for that matter Margaret Thatcher. Speak louder for women speak louder as women."
4308,Obits,Barbara was the Queen mother of American politics and people loved her
4309,Obits,"She may have been brought up in ""considerable affluence."" She may have been a distant relative of Franklin Pierce, and she may have been widely admired. But Mrs. Bush knew what mattered most in life - the love of family. "
4310,Obits,"We come from different parties, but the same path forward. I celebrate Mrs. Bush for her tremendous work for literacy, her forthright opinion on choice and her family's enormous contributions to charity. Godspeed, Mrs. Bush."
4311,Obits,"What a beautiful tribute to a remarkable woman. I imagine she found racism just as profoundly stupid, if not stupider, than I can. I miss her and her familyâs brand of Republicanism; although Iâm nowhere near being an R, they carried that R with compassion, dignity and a moral standing that is SORELY lacking if not completely diminished in this day and age. RIP, good lady."
4312,Obits,"Mere words can not  describe the height and depth and breath of Mrs. Bush's soul molded through a life of service to the American people.  My hope and prayer is that future First Ladies strive to emulate her.<br/><br/>Barbara Bush',s legacy leaves no child behind as she strove to enlighten a generation of children through the simple act of supporting libraries financially as well as working with her talented daughter in law Mrs. Laura Bush."
4313,Obits,Lucky to have her as first lady.  She embodied the word class.  She will be missed as a voice in the American conversation.  We could probably use a few thousand women just like her.  
4314,Obits,"She was a wonderful public figure as First Lady.       Very candid, thoughtful, humble and interesting in her public statements.  Clearly a wonderful mother and wife. Her memoir is a terrific read.  Everyone liked her.  "
4315,Obits,"Mrs. Bush served our nation with honor class style and distinction. May she rest in peace. She was loved by all, GOP and Democrats, including this liberal. "
4316,Obits,"She was terrific. Nancy was brittle and Barbara was a warm family woman. She was funny and sometimes tart about raising her ""kids,"" but I had the strong feeling that they were lucky children and that her husband was a lucky man. Goodnight and good luck (I don't think she'll need it in the afterlife, after a lifetime of looking out for a big family) Mrs GW Bush. And God bless and condolences to her family."
4317,Obits,"May god rest her soul. It has been my lifeâ long dream to meet her husband and shake  his hand. It matters to me, GHWB was first president I voted against. For a naturalized American, who lived here longer than I lived in my native country, it still matters to me to shake the hand of the person that I voted against without losing my head. "
4318,Obits,A wonderful lady who will be missed by all who knew her.
4319,Obits,"She was a rarity in American public life: a genuine person who always spoke her mind without resorting to phoniness or cliches, while always exemplifying class and style.  "
4320,Obits,"My condolences to the Bush family.<br/><br/>The White House issued a statement from Trump on the passing of the former First Lady. The incompetents in this administration can't even give this sad occasion the care and attention it deserves. The statement is dated April, 17, 2017. That's right. The Trump White House can't even get the date right."
4321,Obits,"As an old sixties Lefty Iâve had my share of differences with the Bush clan, but Barbara Bush was a throwback to an earlier era in a most wonderful way in terms of her graciousness and loyalty to both her family and the country. And she was well ahead of her timeâand partyâwhen it came to civil rights and literacy. I hope members of her family will read and derive solace from the comments here that seek to honor her."
4322,Obits,"Rest in Peace, Mrs. Bush"
4323,Obits,"A true example of class, intelligence, and noblesse oblige. What a stunning example of what her party once was. A genuine loss."
4324,Obits,"Iâve read the obituary &amp; many of the positive comments about Barbara Bush here. Undoubtedly much of it is true, never the less I remember her comments in the aftermath of Katrina as well as her dismissive view of the unnecessary death &amp; destruction unleashed by her sons war in Iraq. Mrs Bush was part of the aristocracy here in America that is disdainful of poverty &amp; indifferent to the wars their class sends others to fight &amp; die in. Sorry but itâs true, we would all have been better off if her husband &amp; son had found something else to occupy their time with other than wars in Iraq. "
4325,Obits,"Her decision to forego medical treatment was brave and practical.  Just like her.  RIP, Mrs. Bush.  "
4326,Obits,My condolences to the entire Bush family.
4327,Obits,"Ineffable class.  Standards to aspire to.  In the current political slough, she's a paradigm to be emulated.....  She emphasized education....that is essential.  She  and her ilk will be missed."
4328,Obits,"Barbara Pierce Bush was comfortable in her own skin. Having the maiden name of Pierce and a younger sister with the name of Barbara, I always felt an affinity to the former First Lady despite being a lifelong Democrat. Family was her top priority, a tenant I always adhered to. My heart goes out to her husband and surviving children. "
4329,Obits,"Would that SHE have been President.  <br/><br/>As all contribute, a class act.  During my time as a White House intern (1982-83), it was common knowledge in Washington that VP George Bush Sr. was living with Jennifer Fitzgerald.  But she cherished and honored her duty to the country.  <br/><br/>RIP Mrs. Bush."
4330,Obits,"I admired Mrs. Bush until she attacked President Trump when her son Jeb lost to him in a humiliating defeat.<br/><br/>Until then, she had been a sage woman who was a loyal Republican.  Attacking Trump was very bad form.  "
4331,Obits,"Barbara Bush was a kind, intelligent woman. I hope national reflection at her death will provide an opportunity to remember what classy Republicans were like. "
4332,Obits,"God speed, Mrs. Bush.<br/><br/>She was a class act, and her efforts to promote literacy and to make a mark on the lives of others in a positive way did not go unnoticed by the American people. She was not perfect - none of us are - but her examples of grace, class, quiet dignity, and devotion to her husband and family were things anyone from any political party can and should hold in high esteem, particularly in todayâs rabid, back-biting political environment. Iâm not a Republican and I didnât agree with many of her sonâs policies, but I always thought she deserved to be numbered among our many dignified First Ladies. My condolences to her family on their tremendous loss. "
4333,Obits,My thoughts and prayers are with the Bush family.  She was a wonderful matriarch.  My heart goes out to her husband of 73 years.  What an incredible achievement.
4334,Obits,"The ""Silver Fox"" has left the field.<br/>Farewell!"
4335,Obits,lovely lady    rest in peace  
4336,Obits,"A nicely written piece. I am a life long Democrat, but never felt any animosity at all towards Mrs. Bush, who always seemed to be a truly DECENT person."
4337,Obits,My thoughts and prayers are with the Bush family and friends.  May her love and legacy live on. 
4338,Obits,"Barbara Bush always reminded me of my grandmother, a women I admired and loved for her independence, unpretentiousness, wit and compassion.  When I read that she had opted to end her medical care, I was again reminded of my grandmother, who facing her own end did the same with great grace and courage, the same traits Barbara Bush now doubt showed.<br/><br/>Barbara Bush was exceptional, and like my grandmom, we are all better for the journey she made with us."
4339,Obits,"I am originally from Houston, and several friends working in restaurants and retail stores encountered Mrs. Bush over the years. They all described her the same way, â A down to earth class actâ. When service workers describe you this way, that is saying something. May she Rest In Peace."
4340,Obits,"Barbara Bush seemed like a great person, I wish I could have met her!  I'm sorry to see her pass and my condolences to the Bush family and Mr. Bush especially, 73 years is a long time!"
4341,Obits,"Barbara Bush; you were a dynamic, unpretentious, &amp; very well out -spoken.Never mind the conservative political family; you spoke, agreed , &amp; embraced many women issues unsupported per the republican male genre. It was sad you weren't able to promote Hillary (once Jeb was out of the running) Your family has  remained friends with the Clintons for many years thru out the Bush's &amp; Clinton Presidencies. I'm  saddened you weren't able to promote, assist ,&amp;  expedite Our First woman President. You were ""true blue "" Mrs. Bush,  Rest in peace , you will not be forgotten!"
4342,Obits,A life well lived. She was very admired. May she rest in peace. 
4343,Obits,"Barbara Bush was at her core a Progressive Republican and a free thinker. As an individual she never conformed to the litmus tests for Conservative Females of her era. Her influence on her family was far greater than most people understand. She lamented the idea of war and had a lasting influence on the judgement shown by her husband during the Gulf War to push Iraq out of Kuwait. â What real purpose would America have in marching on through to capture Baghdad, the costs would not be rational and it would not be worth the debt and conflict that would follow back in the United States, I am pleased and very proud of the restraint shown by our military and admire my husbandâs decision to show restraint as modest President even more soâ.<br/>Eleanor Roosevelt, Michelle Obama and Barbra Bush were far more contributing to change in America than even Hillary Clinton. "
4344,Obits,"Barbara Bush was graceful, modest, independent in her thinking and a wonderful First Lady. My sympathies to her family members. May she rest in peace."
4345,Obits,"Her love of family, inspiring work for literacy, humor, graciousness, and strong nature made he widely respected and admired. She will be missed."
4346,Obits,This is what a president's family should be. What a loss.
4347,Obits,"Barbara Bush complained, âI think itâs been the worst campaign Iâve ever seen in my life. I hate that people think compromise is a dirty word. Itâs not a dirty word. . . .<br/>âI think the rest of the world is looking at us these days and saying, âWhat are you doing?ââÂ <br/><br/>And that was in 2013!<br/><br/>Too bad that the same Republicans who are surely lionizing the Silver Fox today were thoroughly unable to heed her wisdom from 2013 and on.<br/><br/>More importantly, they should have definitely listened when she said of Trump during the primaries:<br/>""He doesn't give many answers to how he would solve problems. He sort of makes faces and says insulting things. He's said terrible things about women, terrible things about the military. I don't understand why people are for him, for that reason."""
4348,Obits,"Condolences to the family...she was a wonderful, refreshing and candid lady. She will be missed but deeply remembered."
4349,Obits,"""Iâd like to be known as someone who really cared about people and worked very, very hard to make America more literate.""<br/><br/>A fine epitaph."
4350,Obits,"Such an admirable woman.  As a life-long Democrat, I could not help but respect, admire and love Barbara Bush for her honesty, compassion,  empathy and style.  God speed First Lady Barbara Bush.  You will be missed.   "
4351,Obits,A matriarch of the first order. A life lived well. Condolences.
4352,Obits,"Thank you for your selfless service to us all. May you now rest in peace, dear First Lady, Mrs. Bush. Condolences to your loving family. "
4353,Obits,My condolences to her family.
4354,Obits,A truly classy lady.  Millie is probably jumping for joy!  Thank you and Rest In Peace.
4355,Obits,A legend in American politics has passed.........
4356,Obits,Mrs. Bush was a role model and mentor to many.  Thank you Mrs. Bush.
4357,Obits,"For all the privileges Barbara Bush enjoyed in life, she didn't seem cut out for political living.  Mrs. Bush was a private person and was protective of her husband and children in their public capacity.  The same realm which offered Barbara Bush privilege and opportunity seemed also to encumber her.<br/>And ultimately, she was a wife, mother, grandmother and great-grandmother; in other words, a person who most valued the same things as most people.  "
4358,Obits,A real First Lady - God bless and Rest in Peace
4359,Obits,"God bless. I didn't always appreciate her view, but I did always appreciate her candor. Condolences to the Bush family. "
4360,Obits,I wish I had the confidence she had that must have given her great peace -- but I think she and Robin just had a glorious reunion.  RIP Mrs Bush and condolences to the family.
4361,Obits,May Her Soul Rest with the Lord. And to he Loved ones remain Strong as she did
4362,Obits,"Her head was in the air and her feet were on the ground.  She saw much, inspired many, and led her family through much.  When GWB came home and said of his baseball game ""I won"", she chided him pointing out he was a member of a team, that the team won.  When guest visited the Maine home they were politely encouraged to use towels more than once.  Down home, and down to earth.  RIP"
4363,Obits,"Her politics were not my politics, but I always felt Barbara Bush was a woman I'd enjoy knowing.<br/>That was a time when different politics didn't preclude friendship.<br/>Condolences to the Bush family on the loss of their matriarch."
4364,Obits,"Wait a second- she was in no way a groundbreaking woman. I'm sure she was a good mother and grandmother but that doesn't make her great. If she were not rich or married to a politician, what would she have been? A woman who married at 18 and had a bunch of kids."
4365,Obits,"Real ... as opposed to Jacky? Nancy / Hilary / Laura? Or for that matter Abigail, Eleanor, Mary Todd and the rest of them??"
4366,Obits,Can we please be civil in our expressions of sympathy?
4367,Obits,"I'm a liberal and I liked and admired her very much, thank you. I appreciate her (yes) class and dignity, unlike the inhabitants we currently have in the WH.  RIP Barbara."
4368,Obits,"âVile statements!â Oh, the horror! Someone said that there are people who live BENEATH them...oh god, what ever shall we do??? "
4369,Obits,"We got here because in 1980 George Bush sold out to become Ronald Reagan's vice president despite knowing what a fraud Reagan was. We got here because of two Bush wars in Irag to protect the various petro-states that were funding the same terrorists that would attack us on 09/11. Donald Trump is the logical consequence of the Bush / Reagan years &amp; all that they did and let happen Genuine folk? right! Perhaps to the people they represented IE the privileged class, to the rest of us, not so much.  "
4370,Obits,"Exactly.<br/><br/>One would hope a woman with so much wealth and privilege would do a bit of philanthropy, and championing literacy is clean and easy.  It's not like she was digging up old land mines or putting ointment on leprosy patients with her bare hands.<br/><br/>Let's stop with the canonization of a very ordinary, rather self-absorbed woman who had a far easier life than most Americans ever did or will.  "
4371,Obits,"A victory given us in part by the Bush family. Thanks for nothing, eh. "
4372,Obits,"Such an unnecessary, spiteful, and assumptive comment is not needed in an obituary about any great American."
4373,Obits,"Well, she did quit Smith College in her freshman year. Maybe if she had eventually gotten her degree, she could have been a good candidate for public office. Maybe after the children were grown...<br/><br/>My personal favorite Republican First Lady was Betty Ford. There was an interesting and warmly kind woman, who also spoke her mind and accomplished quite a lot of good with her work in breast cancer and addiction."
4374,Obits,"Agreed.  But she didn't bother her ""beautiful mind"" with such trivia as others' deaths and suffering -- by her own admission.  "
4375,Obits,"Mr. Shaw, your comment moved me to tears, especially the part where you mentioned President Bush being in that 4th grade classroom when the planes hit.  I will never forget the expression of his face.  How he was able to manage such composure having being told what had happened is the kind of inner strength he got from his mother.  Thank you so kindly for your moving and tender comment."
4376,Obits,"@Marge Keller: GWB's expression as he looked up from reading ""The Pet Goat"" on September 11 displayed as much composure as that of a deer caught in high beam headlights.<br/><br/>Get real."
4377,Obits,"Gus, Iâm sure you wouldâve done a better job at that moment. "
4378,Obits,Speak no evil of the recently departed 
4379,Obits,"Actually, Lindsay K, one*s choices pre-conception and pre-natally, as well as afterwards, can have profound lifelong effects on one*s children.  Mrs. Bush acknowledged that her smoking and drinking while pregnant with George W. *made him the way he was.*  "
4380,Obits,Yes.  Precisely. Thank you for saying it. 
4381,Obits,"Speak for yourself.  Barbara Bush was a plute whose real religion was the Almighty Dollar, in her case trust fund money.  And her son 43 was no credit to his raising.  The Bush (originally Boucher) family wanted to establish a pharaonic dynasty to the detriment of our democracy.  They failed.  She's gone. Get over it."
4382,Obits,"No matter what the family does, apparently. "
4383,Obits,It's the platitudes and broad brush that I object to.
4384,Obits,"To be fair, the comments on the Iraq war were taken out of context.<br/><a href=""https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/barbara-bush-beautiful-mind/"" title=""https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/barbara-bush-beautiful-mind/"" target=""_blank"">https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/barbara-bush-beautiful-mind/</a>"
4385,Obits,"Oh, for a return to standards such as hers.   Do you think such things can be taught?"
4386,Obits,"Curious.  The Hitchens article you quote was about how the cheap, partisan attacks on people for being wealthy were tiresome and pointless.  So not only have you taken the occasion of a woman's death to criticize her, you've misunderstood or misrepresented the man you were quoting in the process.  You may note how many people on these pages describe Mrs. Bush as classy.  And you might invest in a mirror."
4387,Obits,You will note that I included Hitchens' remark about how one could see what she was trying to say. I have a mirror. Would you care to borrow it?
4388,Obits,"I very much appreciate this comment.  While I certainly take no joy in anyone's death and wish suffering on no one, I find it deeply upsetting when we forget the cruelty and callousness of the ruling class in a mindless lionizing of someone who I personally met and was, as Al Franken said in one of his books, not a nice person.  She was a patrician in the worst sense of the word, and when we act as though she was a lady of dignity because she happened to be born to tremendous privilege our moral compass becomes meaningless.  "
4389,Obits,"Class and insight.  Too bad that so few in ""the party"" shared her attributes then and now.  "
4390,Obits,"Republican efforst to cut welfare had already started by then. No first-lady pet project can counter the damage of the post-Reagan years on poverty, which is strongly correlated with illiteracy. "
4391,Obits,"@NM -- yes my friend. Mrs. Bush was truly blessed to have a long and rewarding life. As a wife and mother of two presidents and a governor, her pedigree says as much about her as of the Bush family. America is less for her passing."
4392,Obits,What nonsense. Politeness should not be mistaken for affinity or empathy. These patrician old-money family lines exist to lord over the vast majority. 
4393,Editorial,"The Times Editorial Board misrepresents some of the issues associated with Climate Change.  To wit, the worst of the greenhouse gases is water vapor, not carbon dioxide.<br/><br/>This fact is based on an ""in the weeds"" fact, water vapor has more intense infrared absorbance bands than carbon dioxide does; a fact that is critically important in understanding heat retention.<br/><br/>For the three (3) primary fossil fuels, relatively speaking coal is richer in carbon than it is in hydrogen, whereas natural gas is richer in hydrogen than it is in carbon.  Coal on this basis is a heavy emitter of carbon dioxide and natural gas is a heavy emitter of water vapor.<br/><br/>On a unit basis, the consumption of coal produces the most carbon dioxide, whereas the consumption of natural gas produces the most water vapor.<br/><br/>While there is little to debate on Mr. Pruitt's behavior, on the science, he has it mostly right.  The Times Editorial Board is correct to be critical of Mr. Pruitt's behavior, but The Times Editorial Board needs to consult with those of us in the know on the scientific aspects of climate change in order to be credible on this important issue/matter."
4394,Editorial,It's time to rename the EPA - Environmental Pollution Agency. 
4395,Editorial,"There is no doubt that the EPA, or any other government agency, could be streamlined and still perform their missions.   However, Pruitt seems hell bent on destroying the noble mission of the EPA, not making it more effective and efficient."
4396,Editorial,Ugh. How can the Times substitute the nonsensical âby common consensusâ for the stock phrase âby common consentâ?
4397,Editorial,What also disturbs me about Pruitt and the rest of the swamp dwellers in this administration is the firing or demoting of so many decent hard working civil servants that are just trying to do their jobs of protecting our country and seeing to it that our tax dollars are wisely spent. By the time Democrats can take control of the White House again and restore competence and decency to our government we will have lost many public servants as they will have moved on to other careers. It will take a long time to rebuild our once great government.
4398,Editorial,"One can only hope that the pendulum of karma swings and hits these miscreants so hard we never have to see them again, if only in a mugshot. However, even the joy I confess I'd get from seeing Pruitt get his comeuppance won't change a thing as far as the damage he and his fellow appalling cohorts are inflicting on our planet. When people have had enough of this horror they will use the boycott and other forms of effective non-violent protest and shut down ""the machine"", just as Mario Savio advised us to do in 1964..."
4399,Editorial,"Once again, even though this editorial is about Mr. Pruitt it speaks volumes about the man who put him in charge of the E.P.A. Every day it's a new revelation as to what motivates this president to do the things he does. Sometimes it's a shell game so we look over there when we should be looking elsewhere. Sometimes it's right in our faces and he is telling us he couldn't care less what anyone thinks about it. Sometimes it's all about dismantling anything the former president put into place, and sometimes it's just shocking all of us for the sake of keeping his face front and center every minute of the news day. In the case of Mr. Pruitt, Mr. Trump has outdone himself by covering all of these bases and in finding someone who is almost his equal when it comes to sticking it to the American voters. We should have realized this when Mr. Pruitt said he wanted to be treated like he was the president."
4400,Editorial,"Day after day,,there are stories like this about someone in Trumpâs Administration. This has gone well beyond politics and political,philosophy, but, many of those in the Republican Party continue to support guys like this, simply because theyâre members of the Party. If ever a political party deserved to be disbanded,,itâs the modern Republican Party."
4401,Editorial,"I would hope more research is done on this with a possible referral for prosecution, if warranted, under 18 USC Chapter 31.  The spending of government monies, for personal profit, without a legitimate business reason fits within several categories of theft and embezzlement set out in Chapter 31.<br/>If this were a county employee doing this type of thing, most District Attorneys would seek an indictment, else face being voted out of office in the next election."
4402,Editorial,"""Become Ridiculous?"".....from day one, just like trump, a total nightmare, to humans, animals and the planet! He needs to really Go!"
4403,Editorial,"WAKE up dude.  <br/><br/>And smell the air in my and many other cities around the world.  Then check what actual credible scientists say about climate change.  Did ya know that EVEN Exxon-Mobil recognizes that there IS climate change.  Really.  They've gone on record.  <br/><br/>Check another news source besides Fox, Jones, Limbaugh and their likes you might learn some TRUTH's."
4404,Editorial,Mueller may be an exception.
4405,Well,"Ok, so a handful of walnuts each day along with Fish Fillets and Big Macs wonât do your body good, but as the atudy says, if those consuming most nuts are also engaging in other healthy behaviors, then nuts are icing on the cake. Somewhat like wine and the French paradox where red wine along with smaller portions, food grown without round up and more physical acotovry than Americans leads French to have less disease than Americans.

4416,National,"Southwest has a remarkable safety record. I am sure the entire company is saddened by the tragic loss of even one life. <br/><br/>My heart goes out to Ms. Riordan's husband and children, her co-workers, family, and friends. Who gets on a plane and worries about getting sucked out of the window. Just a horrible thought that other passengers had to witness or experience. <br/><br/>What concerns me most is what company rebuilt the engine. Usually, the company doing the periodic maintenance on the plane is not the company that specializes in taking apart and rebuilding the engines. Planes are hard to move but engines can be trucked across the border and worked on in Mexico.<br/><br/>Every one of the fan blades is supposed to be x-rayed to spot even microscopic cracks and weak points. Multiple mechanics with government-issued licenses must sign off on every single step. Was cost-cutting involved by Southwest or the maintenance company? Was the engine maintenance company operating in a low wage foreign country?<br/><br/>I agree that the FAA needs to go back to doing enforcement and not being an advisory partner to the airlines. That FAA bureaucrat that 60 Minutes interviewed last Sunday did not give me much confidence that his agency was doing a good job overseeing airline safety.

By their very nature, contrasts may be unsavory, but still enjoyable and maybe enlightening. "
4419,BookReview,"*Sigh* Writing is writing, and only a person of boring privilege feels the need to make herself interesting in such a way. A narrative of recovery? Naw, I'll pass."
4420,BookReview,"First the reviewer states the book should take its place among ""recovery memoirs"" and not seek to transcend  the genre. Then she says the book is lacking for not appealing to a more general audience. Which is it? "
4421,BookReview,There are many interesting ideas to write about with a shot of whiskey; there is nothing interesting to write about with an empty bottle of whiskey.
4422,BookReview,"By her theory I guess Naked Lunch must be the greatest novel ever written.  Pretty banal reading if you ask me. The idea that drugs serve creativity is a very bad one. The idea that anyone else might want to read about it is worse. <br/><br/>When he was playing with Miles, John Coltrane nearly destroyed his talent with his addiction to heroin. He was soon kicked out of Miles band and the quality of his music declined greatly. Through tremendous strength of will and the help of his wife he was able to quit heroin cold turkey. After his recovery he went on to produce some of the greatest music ever created, and at the same time became a spiritual inspiration for many generations of people, including his own children. Sounds like a damn good redemption story to me. <br/><br/>As the father of an alcoholic, I can assure you that addiction and inebriation produce nothing but pain."
4423,BookReview,Most mind altering substances empower creativity. But at some point one has to wake up one morning and read the unreadable. Writing under the influence is an abstraction of the truth. Just like all the sex that she purportedly was engaging in. I think what may be missing here is a muse. Something all creative achievements longingly ache for. Crumpled up a newspaper into a small ball. Then write about it as it unfolds.

4426,BookReview,"Iâm confused a bit. Has she outed anyone but herself, is so, I agree. If it is just her self disclosure I suppose she does run the risk of tainting her process with image management (fame) and other character distortions. Having said that, I feel AAâs has in no way cornered the market  on âthe right wayâ. Language like âviolating the traditionâ and she âneeds a chat with her sponsorâ reflects is pedantic and smug attempt to declare A.A. as the only truth. Weirds me out complete. "

4428,BookReview,"You are right that people of color often do not have the privilege of putting their stories out there and making money from lucrative publishing contracts.<br/>However, alcoholism does not discriminate.  A homeless black man who has suffered because of racism in our country and a privileged white person, both recovering in AA, have something in common - their lives have become unmanageable because of their drinking.  The only requirement for membership is a desire to stop drinking.  There definitely is institutionalized racism &amp; classism in this country but that does not prevent people of all races &amp; classes from becoming alcoholics or drug addicts."
4429,Business,"Starbucks and McDonalds bathrooms are major destinations for homeless people. The bathrooms are used not only for elimination but for bathing.  Hence, requiring a purchase before using a locked bathroom is Starbuck's way to address the issue of homeless people using their bathrooms.  Not every Starbucks has a locked bathroom. Company Management should have a clear policy on which stores require locked bathrooms and how their staff should address the issue of bathroom use by people who don't want to purchase a product.  "
4430,Business,"While discrimination is real and Philly has its tension dynamics, former Starbuck CEO, Howard Schultz, asked for a race conversation and he was taunted mercilessly from all sides. <br/><br/>Unless everyone, white, black and otherwise* are willing to swallow their pride and hear each other out, there will never be real harmony<br/><br/>* yea, I personally know some non-black minority members who are fearful of black in the area, Obviously, their fear is expressed in racist tendency but getting robbed in the Temple U area when they were poor students tend to leave terrible impression. Obviously, that was a long time ago. Once upon a time, U Penn students would not go beyond 51st Street, Now, Philly gentrification behaves like other major cities. "
4431,Business,While I agree with most of your observations - it should be noted that the incident report given to the PPD Desk Sergeant cites supporting statements made by two customers of Starbucks that they too requested the intervention of (sic) Starbucks staff in light of the inappropriate language being used by the two youths - which could be heard three tables distant. I suspect that Starbucks staff only intervened as a last resort - and did not physically intimidate the two as they did the 22 year old lead barista...

4434,Washington,"Trump withdrawal from sanctions on Russia lay bare his thinly veiled attempt to show he is not in Putin's pocket when he Twitted recently taunting Putin regarding use of chemical weapons in Syria.<br/><br/>The taunt was to demonstrate to his true believers that he, Trump, is not compromised by Russia.  But his refusal to take action against Russia broadcasts to the thinking mind that he is compromised by Russia."

This agency has played no role in our victories and has done nothing to prevent our challenges. <br/><br/>Yet you cheer for it, simply because you hate some of your fellow Americans, who would rather be their own people than mere deductions."
4438,Washington,"Despite the frustration of what is likely a heavily overloaded system as a result of last minute filers, the Trump Republican Tax Bill is a highly regressive bill serving mostly giant once American companies (now called ""multi-nationals""), and moves about $1.4 trillion, mostly from the dwindeling middle class to the super rich.  Google the recent article entitled ""The Republican tax bill got worse: now the top 1% gets 83% of the gains"".  To make matters worse, this bill meets the agenda of the like's of the Koch Brothers and their megalithic propaganda machine and fake ""representatives"" who use their money to get elected and push their self serving greed.   The Trump Republican Tax Bill literally steals from the rich to give to the poor, who now more than ever, don't need a tax break.  The same people who pushed this like Ryan, McConnell and mostly the Goldman Alumni in the White House and Trump don't care that this bill creates massive debt, something Ryan and so many of the Koch Republicans promised they were against.  Hypocrisy?  Yes, but the corruption has run deep for a long time.  If we end up with a fascist, authoritarian neo-nazi police state, it is because good people didn't get into action, vote, drive voters to polling stations, volunteer at phone banks, protest, post truth on social media and challenge the so called ""news"" networks that report anything other than what real journalism calls for, unbiased, ethics based, TRUTH!"
4439,Washington,"Federal employees are fired if they try a walkout. Remember the air traffic controlers strike under Reagan?  <br/><br/>But they are true professionals. Did you listen to the audio of that Southwest flight coming into Philadelphia after the engine blew and shrapnel penetrated the plane.  The (female) pilot was unflappable--a veteran, former Navy F18 fighter pilot. And the air traffic controller was equably unflappable, despite all the other flights he was controlling.<br/><br/>We really do not appreciate our civil servants.  Agencies are being bled dry.  We often find out how valuable and high quality their services have been after they deteriorate or disappear."

4441,Culture,"When engaging in this conversation, I think it's important to remind ourselves of the guidelines set forth by The Pulitzer Prize committee. The prize is awarded: âFor distinguished musical composition by an American that has had its first performance or recording in the United States during the year, Fifteen thousand dollars ($15,000).â Accordingly, the only requirements aside from residency and year produced are that (1) the musical composition is considered distinguished, and (2) that it's a musical composition. I've read through all the comments, and there seems to be several recurring points of contention, most of which center around the latter criterion. Many disagree that the recipient's album is not, for one reason or another, a musical composition. Some argue that the genre under which the music is categorized, rap/hip-hop, does not meet the standards to be considered a musical composition. I'm no musical scholar, but at a passing glance it seems to be a musical composition: there's instrumentation arranged in a certain order set to certain signatures of time. Some cite that because the instrumentation is not technically complex it therefore should be disregarded. Again, in the above criteria, the prize is not necessarily awarded to the most technically complex music. Others cite that the act of ârappingâ is not musical and therefore it should follow that it cannot be apart of a musical composition. "
4442,Culture,The problem with rap for me is that it does not contain the 3 necessary components of music. It has rhythm and harmony but it does not have melody. It tries to make up for this with its rhythmic intensity and searing lyrics but it still lacks melody. 
4443,Culture,"Fascinating conversation, disturbing that nearly every artist cited, including the other two artists considered for the prize, are male. "
4444,Culture,"It's fair to not like or listen to hip-hop music. It is NOT fair to degrade an ARTIST for his work because his field is more commercialized. Just because Kendrick Lamar won a Pulitzer for music and he is a Hip-Hop artist, doesn't mean that we have to start overlooking classical music or jazz. But, to say that Kendrick's work is not music at all or shouldn't even be considered poetry is ignorant to say the least. A lot of Hip-Hop today is not the best but being as though there is a jury to decide who would win this prize and none of you are on it, I personally would assume that they might know something we don't. I'm also not saying that Kendrick is the first deserving artist outside of Classical or Jazz. I just believe that we are taking a step in the right direction for acknowledging new genres as eligible."
4445,Culture,"I suggest that potential commenters read the lyrics to the DAMN album before commenting. The prose is breathtakingly sharp - Lamar sees the world so clearly, without any filter, that each line cuts is like a knife - but because of its truth, it's also like an embrace.<br/><br/>A bold and surprising, yet - if you do your homework - obvious choice."
4446,Culture,"Nice conversation. Having bought my first rap record - Kurtis Blow's ""The Breaks"" (after hearing it at the Mudd Club) - uh, a couple of years ago, I agree wholeheartedly that ""To Pimp A Butterfly"" is better and has more breadth than ""DAMN.""  <br/><br/>As for Steve Reich's ""Music for 18 Musicians,"" it didn't hold a candle to ""The Clash.""  "
4447,Culture,"@CHE<br/>Ha Ha Ha!<br/>Tell that to all the inner city hoods and gangsters as they listen to this ""poetry"" .. To this day they commit felonies and atrocities across the United States inspired by anger and hate infused rap lyrics. <br/><br/>""Rap"" has done more to destroy and divide race relations in this country than Jim Crow. ... Last attempt I know of a song designed to unite ""the divide"" was was ""Ebony and Ivory"" [Jackson-McCartney] and I don't recall hearing that ""beat"" blast from drop top caddies as they dipped and bounced through downtown Detroit, St. Louis, Memphis, Jacksonville,  Oakland, L.A. ..

No.  ""A cook?"" Not really.  ""A manager?""  Sort of, but not really.<br/><br/>As this article points out, The chef might be the featured performer, but the expediter is the conductor.  ""Conducting"" a kitchen demands an impeccable sense of timing, an infinite amount of grace under pressure, and the ability to navigate the often rocky divide between the front and the back of the house.  It is a very difficult job, and in my career i have seen very few people with the natural ability to do it well.  "

4464,Travel,"I lived in Bolivia. Sure, if all you see is the tourist circuit, like this author did, women are highly visible as vendors. But sexism, domestic abuse, and sexual harassment are rampant. All of those women you saw in the market are working to bring home their wages to support their families because the men, if theyâre still around, are drunk and unemployed. Rates of infant and maternal mortality are some of the highest in Latin America (thanks largely to the Catholic Church and its prohibition on contraception). This article was facile and did not even begin to scratch the surface of what Bolivian women endure. Their cheerfulness in the face of it all is a testament to their fortitude. "
4465,Travel,"Great article, was opportune since I was reading while I was awaiting my flight to La Paz. The city is one of the more interesting places Iâve been to before. Iâm glad you mentioned Bolivian Popular Food restaurant, I had a great lunch there yesterday. I sat at the bar and watched one of the hardest working kitchens Iâve seen prepare lunch. And made it to Gustu last night for the tasting menu that was really wonderful. "
4466,Travel,There is nothing more beautiful or empowering than watching a cholita using a cell phone in downtown La Paz to check up on her mother in El Alto. It is tradition meeting technology. 
4467,Travel,"Thumbs up for the article!   La Paz is great fun.  The aerial trams are a terrific way to travel.  They are clean and quiet and yes, one does meet a cross section of Bolivians who are very proud of the tram system and eager to share their thoughts.  For Americans traveling to Cusco and Machu Picchu, consider adding a few days in La Paz.  It's an easy ad-on and after Cusco you'll be used to the altitude.  "
4468,Travel,"Many years ago, while in graduate school I became friends with a wonderful woman who was doing graduate work in Anthropology.  With assistance from a prestigious grant program, she was able to spend several months in Cuzco, studying the women who ran the market there, because the men were off working in the mines.  As a single woman, she said they often asked her, ""Where is your man?""  "
4469,Travel,"Fascinating story.  I spent a month in LaPaz 50 years ago.  Now that I think about it, most of the vendors we encountered then were women.  Thank  you."
4470,Travel,"I thought this article was a bit weak. <br/><br/>There are many companies offering women only travel experiences because they're wanted - NOT as a knee jerk reaction to the #MeToo movement. <br/><br/>This looks like a win for the marketing department of the company you mention. Not really informative. <br/><br/>As another commenter states, Road Scholars as well as others are good women only choices. <br/><br/>Susan<br/>Expat in Ireland "

If you think that the typos made by the professors in this article are bad, you should read the students' work.  Most of their writing is totally unintelligible. It is amazing to me that many even graduated high school. I don't mean to be too elitist &amp; I understand that accepting students with poor academic abilities could be helpful to them (though maybe not to their classmates), but the fact of the matter is that these students' abilities never seem to improve &amp; they are never taught needed elementary-level skills (except maybe when outsourced to me &amp; my coworkers, but most need to work w/ teachers w/ special ed or ESL training that we do not have), let alone actual college-level ones needed to succeed after graduation. I consistently see the same errors with almost all Liberty students, such as not knowing how to introduce quotes, that I rarely see with students at other universities. They are also required to cite/discuss the Bible &amp; in every paper &amp; every subject, not matter how unrelated- science, business, etc.  Some of their science papers require them to defend totally unscientific arguments, such as the existence of God, the new earth theory, etc. They are doing a huge disservice to their students &amp; to taxpayers who fund their scam. Iâd be very happy if this university shut down, even though it would mean losing a big chunk of my own income source. "

I can't speak to the quality of their online offerings, but from what I can tell, their on-campus academics are also in line with lower mid-tier public institutions. <br/><br/>My objection to the school is almost purely philosophical. I am an engineer by trade and an ardent supporter of the hard sciences, which Liberty and its leadership pay lip service to while openly propagating the anti-intellectual evangelical mantra of Bible first and empirical facts later, as they are conveniently in ""agreement"" with the Bible. So as someone interested in a science based education, Liberty offers the weakest foundation I've ever seen.<br/><br/>On the other hand, objections to Liberty's non-profit status are entirely misplaced, and likely rooted in objections to the institution on other grounds. The fact is, Liberty University fits the definition of non-profit to the letter, and anybody doubting that should look it up."

4484,Magazine,The universities you list provide an actual education.  Liberty is a scam masquerading as an institution of higher learning.

4488,BookReview,Thank you for these recommendations! I will need to look into these stories.
4489,Magazine,"The letter was one of many of the late mother's ""old papers.""   Put them in a box and ask your brother if he wants to review.  He may have no interest; he may want to review everything; he may want a keepsake sample of your mother's handwriting.  I would not curate your mother's received correspondence and hand one piece to one child.  By the way, my name would have been Christopher if I were a boy and my brother (not a Christopher) would have been Irene if he were a girl. "
4490,Magazine,"""I'm telling you this for your own good""... but actually it is for my own good, in that it relieves me from having to carry on a pretense.  If the sister-in-law wasn't made aware of the illness and its progression, there's nothing great to be gained by introducing great sadness into her world. Barring some unusual situation, it's ok to allow someone to assume the healthy and cheerful status of a party who is no longer with us. The urgency to share bad news is not helping the recipient; when someone reaches 92, there has been no shortage of bad news and loss. A little more energy could have been put into making the response something besides an uncomfortable, blatant lie, and the big confession (I cannot tell a lie. Mom's dead and your daughter has been deceiving you) just created tension where none need be.  "
4491,Magazine,"#1: I agree that the well-meaning cousin should not have asked that her mother be kept in the dark. But the letter-writer, having agreed to this request, should not have broken her agreement in the way she did. Rather, she should have told the cousin that she could not continue the deception, and let the cousin decide how her mother was going to learn the news that her daughter had been lying to her.<br/><br/>#2  Share the letter, but make no assumptions or comments about how the brother should or might react to it. The parents were the parents of all their offspring, and one sibling does not have the right to hide the letter from another sibling.<br/><br/>#3  Particularly with legal work, the amount of time spent on a task often does not correlate to the quality of the end result. If the colleague is doing her share of the work and doing it well, then how many hours she spends at it (or when those hours occur) are not the co-worker's business. I suspect the letter-writer would feel less disgruntled, and the organization would be better served, if the tasks involved were thought of not as a product of x number of hours, but rather as a series of goals that need to be accomplished. That way, it would be immediately clear whether the colleague was indeed shirking - that is, goals not accomplished - or was just particularly efficient - that is, goals accomplished although in fewer hours. The latter should be applauded, not criticized."
4492,Magazine,"The Ethicistâs advice is a good way to make an enemy of your boss and possibly entangle you in board politics and drama.  Rarely is going to the board without the approval of your boss a good idea.   Having a direct conversation with your boss is a better idea.  You could say, âI am having trouble getting in touch with Sally today and have a pressing matter.  How would you like me to handle this situation?â   Keep your focus on getting your job done, keep it professional and focus on your work.  You never know why someone might have a different arrangement - making assumptions about the reason paints you in a whining light (itâs not fair!) and thatâs not going to cast an attractive hue.  If favoritism is involved youâre not going to fix it - only make yourself look bad.  "

4494,Upshot,"I hate to disabuse Dr. Khullar, but after recently dealing with a cardiac problem, my experience was that doctors were no better (and often worse) at evaluating risk.  When someone claims a superior ability to evaluate anything, beware.  It's the delusion called arrogance.  <br/><br/>I'm quite capable of evaluating risk in my life.  It's called, when last I looked, taking responsibility for my decisions.  I'm the only one who can do that.  I'm happy to listen.  In the end, I'm the one that decides (or the two tough souls to whom I've given power of attorney, if it comes to that).   My life; my death.  What is everyone so afraid of?"
4495,Upshot,"Valuable contribution.<br/><br/>Does the physician know the percentage of patients receiving recommendations for treatment for men 77-to- 80 years of age? <br/><br/>Urologists often do not consult the 77 to 80 year-old patient, EVEN in cases where there is only a Stage 1 prostate cancer, found in only 1 of 12 cores, and with the best Gleason score of 3 + 3. <br/><br/>They recommend treatment!<br/><br/>Might the doc's wallet be making the decision? Methinks it quite likely. What do you think?"
4496,Upshot,"I have yet to meet a doctor who wants to help me evaluate risk. <br/><br/>I have, however, met a succession of doctors over the years who withhold all information about risk, misrepresent the purpose of a procedure, refuse to discuss choices, or flat-out lie about the risks -- whatever it takes to get the patient to say 'yes' as quickly as possible. <br/><br/>The whole concept of patient autonomy seem to be anathema to them. Naturally, my naive confidence in the medical ethics of informed consent is destroyed, and my trust in the medical profession has taken quite a hit."
4497,Upshot,Itâs like playing a matching game between doctors and patients.
4498,Upshot,"Agree. When patients ask me if they should be worried about a TV ad for a drug, which mentions the risk of a drug, I tell them that the ad never mentions the degree of risk. If they had to advertise cars the way that drugs are advertised, every car would come with a disclaimer that ""people have been killed in this car"". For some drugs I suspect that the risk of getting killed on the way to the pharmacy to pick it up is greater than the risk of getting killed by the drug. We need to be informed about risks and benefits in real numbers, not just scary (or falsely reassuring) statements"
4499,Upshot,I'm in a similar situation and to me a 13% risk is huge compared to anything else in my life.  Only a small percentage of people who take statins have side significant effects.  You won't know if you're one of those people until you try.
4500,Upshot,"Ben, my husband and I have been treated by lots of really excellent physicians.  In particular, our primary care docs are top-notch.

We have one of the smallest commons area that I've seen leading people to stand in the hallway. <br/><br/>Probably the most frustrating thing is that instead of improving our school or other schools in the district like ours, the county decides to build another school. This school will millions in which we could have used to greatly improve our struggling school. Unfortunately the best solution to this problem is to build a new concord high school. However, this probably wont happen for a while, despite the terrible school experience. "
4504,Learning,"Money is one of the most important thing we need in life. You need money for almost everything. Since I was younger, I always heard that school is the best way to success. I agree with the author school need more money and will always need money .An institution for educating should be somewhere comfortable because as you learning you need peace to be focus otherwise it will be difficult to learn correctly. I make this rapprochement to explain that for the student to be well educated you need money for several things such as paying teachers and the other employees. Students need more school furniture. Some things need to be fixed like classroom, upgrade school libraries, repair computer or replace them by new ones, change things that need to be changed such as boardsâ desks tablesâ chairs, fixe bathrooms. Some school need more school supplies. In my opinion I think they should increase teacher salaries because of their great job. Having patience to educate people is not something easy. In addition, I think the state should increase their effort on giving money to school. My school need more money because they have lots of work to do. In some ways student need to protect their school furniture. At last, all I can say is school really need more money."
4505,Learning,"In my opinion, the public school should have a bigger budget for the scholar items. The government have to worry more in schools because our future starts from the school. Talking like a student, I could not feel good and comfortable in a space where always is dirty and smells old. We are creating the future but we cannot create something well if we do not feel good. To have something broken attract bad energies. Having broken books, this split the ideas, they are diluted and they generate negativity. When I was in Colombia, most of the schools did not have too much budget; this is because the governed do not help the public schools. Comparing with U.S is very different the form of how they manage that. This country has more means than Colombia, and more money. U.S spends more money in the health service and in the schools but Colombia spends more money in the government and in the treat peace; all of those is for the corruption. In conclusion, in this age U.S should spend more money in education than for the war. In addition, Colombia have to learn a little more of U.S in the ambit of how treat people and help the schools."
4506,Learning,"The most common contemporary discussion of education reform is that, âIf schools had more money, then they would do better at educating kidsâ. Every school need more money for more improvement. I studied in a public high school and sadly to tell about my high school that we do not have access to our computer lab because none of them is working. However, one of my lab teacher brought five laptop using his own pocket money but he did not get enough salary. Therefore, our school need more money to repair those computer, damage furniture, buy more books for library but they do not get those money because the state cutting the budget money. My father is a government assistant teacher. I saw him spending a lot of money from his own pocket for his own classroom but he is not getting enough salary. So in my opinion on teacher salaries that needs to be increase because they are not paid fairly. I think government need to increase their budget for the school to improve the education system."
4507,Learning,"I completely agree that creating a foundation in reading for younger kids is of the utmost importance. When I was little I hated reading and avoided it whenever possible, but it wasn't until one teacher presented it in a way that sounded fun that I learned to love it. If children are not given the opportunity to explore the different types of books out there and grow as a student then we are hindering the progress of generations to come. Teachers are tasked with shaping the minds of children and pushing them to grow in their learning. If budget cuts hinder teachers from doing this then they should be able to protest. "
4508,Learning,"I agree with your statement, tenure is a large issue resulting in low performance teachers. Do you believe completely removing tenure from the public education system is the right move to make? In theory it would give an incentive for high skilled teachers to put more effort into their work, but would it cause outrage in the workforce as a whole? "
4509,Learning,"Part 2:<br/>As for the article, yesterday's conditions for the Boston Marathon were awful.<br/>As Ms. Andrews states ""Linden and the rest of the field faced a headwind of about 10 miles per hour and temperatures of 38 degrees at the starting line on Monday. But the conditions did not stop Linden and Yuki Kawauchi, 31, who came from behind to win the menâs race. He is the first Japanese man to win the race since 1987, the year Kawauchi was born.""

4514,Washington,"Is there a consistent and persistent pattern to the latest action reversing additional sanctions on Russia.  From before he took office Trump was working to remove sanctions resulting in Mike Flynn's perjury and firing and then that of FBI Director James Comey who refused to let this ""good guy"" off.  Of course, even before that Russians were offering ""dirt"" on Hillary Clinton to the Trump high command in return for lifting the sanctions under the Magnitsky Act. Then there was the failed attempt to return the Russian compounds seized by President Obama.  More recently, both Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and National Security Adviser H. R. McMaster were fired immediately after giving tough speeches about sanctioning Russia. And, President Trump has been reported that he was tricked into expelling 60 Russians when other nations expelled far fewer ""diplomats.""  And still we hear Mr. Trump protest over and over, ""No collusion, no collusion!"""
4515,Washington,How many more times do you suppose Haley will make speeches and demands only to have it all reversed by Trump. Her credibility at the UN is pretty much zero at this point. Not sure why she is even there. 
4516,Washington,"So Trump sent missiles to bomb chemical weapons facilities in Syria, but wonât place sanctions against companies that assisted in creating these weapons? Makes perfect sense."
4517,Washington,"If I were to think of a single adjective to describe former FBI Director James Comey dating back to 2016, I would choose ""unhelpful."" If I were to think of an adverb to modify the adjective, I would select ""spectacularly."" <br/><br/>I think I am being overly generous here. In his sanctimony, the man is almost as carelessly egotistical as the figure he helped make president and whom he now vilifies with such apparently gleeful abandon."
4518,Washington,Petty? Indeed! A lot of good his cultivated image did him with the lunatic president and his lunatic fans.
4519,Washington,"John Dean, the White House counsel for Richard Nixon in the early 1970s, also had his character and image attacked and bruised for telling the truth about a presidentâs evil actions in the White House. Dean survived the character assassinations and became widely known as the honest one who helped save the nation from the high crimes of the Watergate scandal. So, too, may James Comey become known and remembered for his outspoken revelations as he also attempts to save the country from a lying, corrupt president."
4520,Washington,"Sacrificing a cultivated image?  Who cares?  When one is selling books, any publicity is good publicity.  He's doing exactly what he intends: enriching himself by boosting book sales.   In other words, another Trump-like sleazeball."
4521,Washington,"Comey has had to face some dilemmas, and some of his choices have been controversial. In this imbroglio, he can either respond in kind to Trump's ad hominem attacks, thereby refuting them in stark terms, or he can ignore them and roll over. The latter may be more dignified, but dignity isn't a remedy to Donald Trump. I'm happy to see Mr. Comey rip into the President because the rest of the GOP certainly doesn't have the intestinal fortitude to do so. Silence is complicity, and I've seen enough of that already. The court of public opinion will be the final arbiter of the character of these two men. My decision was an easy one."

What you are saying is that trump can say whatever he wants and everyone else criticizing trump is descending. You are helping Trump with your assumptions no the other way around; implying that Comey is in âdescendâ only because he is describing literally what he witnessed when he met and spoke with trump, seems unfair. It is also an insult to Comey to say that âhere we have the former head of a supposedly scrupulous, detached federal agency reaching for Mafia metaphorsâ¦â¦etcââ¦. Were you expecting Comey to describe his experiences with trump in a ârosyâ manner?  He is no longer the FBI director or serving the country in any capacity. As a civilian he can express in whatever manner he wants his real experiences with trump; trump got nothing on Comey. You just canât compare them."

4540,Foreign,"The State has always been an institution since Classical times that manages civilian compliance through threat, punishment and disaster intervention.  That is among the reasons why the Patriot Act and the larger, sprawling security infrastructure is organized around large-scale civilian authority status, and why terror is among the most ideal cognitive and emotional routines that trigger its activation.  Indeed, terror can be synthetically applied to any number of otherwise independent events.  Cyber security warnings issued with great urgency by the US and UK over the past 72 hours is an example of pretext opportunity, as are natural disasters.  The NYT has a front-page report this morning on earthquake risk in San Francisco.  And every day the public is bombarded with fear stimulation signals from media and government.  Lastly, this is why global warming and climate change--rather than merely pollution--is also an ideal civilian intervention construct, due to its catastrophist ideology, and thereby an assumed global government mandate.  Unchecked and unbalanced indeed.  "

4570,Upshot,"Time and again Donald Trump's unharnessed campaign-style rhetoric and stream of semi-consciousness tweeting about international trade flows, tariffs, currency fluctuations, and the like, prove that he has little or no knowledge of the subject.  Not only does he lack theoretical understanding, he cannot even get the basic facts straight.<br/><br/>The same can be said about his ignorance of macroeconomics, and his general indifference to how monetary and fiscal policy impact real lives.  All he really wanted in the Ryan tax cut was a ""win"" for himself, and a windfall for his billionaire backers.  The bill's substance, and its short and long term consequences, mattered hardly a bit.  The same applies to his sledge-hammer approach to tariffs.  <br/><br/>So where does Donald Trump's ""businessman's expertise"" lie?  A series of bankruptcies along with a record of underhanded cheating of business partners, creditors, and contractors provide the answer.  If this is what his ""base"" has been led to accept as evidence of ""business expertise,"" it's pretty unattractive.  Each Trump business episode would make for a riveting chapter in ""The Thin Book of Business Ethics.""  Give me an experienced politician, even a shady one, any day over this.<br/><br/>Two years of undergraduate real estate wheeling and dealing courses at Wharton. That's it.  Plus a mogul real estate father with a similar record of ethical shortcuts.  That's Trump's sum total economics background. "
4571,Upshot,"Trump is a child. He stopped thinking in extended logical sequences years ago. As far as I can tell, his starting point for considering any issue is that his convictions are always right, and that he is a genius. He will cherry pick his way through facts to fit a passing whim or hastily reached conclusion. But you can be sure that Trump will always conclude that Trump is right, regardless of the facts. <br/><br/>Trying to unpack his tweets or find consistent policy assumptions and conclusions is like trying to chart the future by consulting a Magic Eight Ball. The best you can hope for over the next two years is that Trump's aides and career government officials can slowly convince him on occasion to trust the experts and stop lunging to the wrong conclusions. <br/><br/>God help us.

Our foreign trade would be in balance. What others do from that point on would not upset our balance of trade. If others then ""retaliate"" by following suit, fine!"
4573,Upshot,"The question that needs to be asked is why is the US$ so strong? If China can manipulate its currency, so can US manipulate its. So the question is, why didn't Obama administration manipulate its value down? Who benefited from strong $ policy? Lets keep in mind that there is no such a thing as a free market, everything is manipulated. The only question is, for whose benefit? In US political system, the winners are always the political donors. At the same time, why haven't US interest rates gone up? Obviously because the FED works for the banks, not American people. The policies are government is pursuing are benefiting the wealthy to the detriment of the middle class. The damage that has been inflicted on the middle class has been severe. But our governments could care less about it, they only take care of the donors. So lets stop complaining about China is manipulating its currency, if there had been a will to solve the problem it would have been solved long ago."
4574,Upshot,"Trump is in way over his head on trade and and currency issues, ignoring the advice of the actual experts like his own Treasury Dept. What do they know?<br/><br/>He demands that China open its market to US vehicles by eliminating the 25% Chinese tariff on imports, which they have already announced they are reducing. <br/><br/>But he seems ignorant of a 25% US tariff on the huge light truck market imposed during the Johnson Administration, also known as the ""Chicken Tax"", that still survives today for purely protectionist reasons. <br/><br/>Not even Trump would be foolish enough to trade away the US light duty market of millions of trucks to sell a few thousand novelty trucks in China to billionaires.<br/><br/>His currency views are no better informed."

He does not talk as if he attended any college English classes. <br/><br/>Maybe Trump did like Rodney Dangerfield in the movie ""Back to School"" and just hired other students to attend his classes and take his tests for him. <br/><br/>I do not remember any of my college class instructors requesting that I produce a picture ID to prove that I was really the person taking that class, so maybe that is/was possible."

I don't think the series really needs a season 2, because there's nowhere to go with it other than what we've already seen.  Of course, there are a lot more volcanoes in the northwest that you can explode...  "
4589,Culture,"I love this show. I would be very upset if it does not get renewed. How sad that critics do not see it as the great drama that I do. The scene between Duc and Greg was probably one of the highlights of the season for me. No idea whatâs going on with the volcano, but Iâd love to find out."
4590,Culture,"Clearly it's not mental illness if Ike, Ramon, Farid, and little Hailey are experiencing the same thing, in various degrees. The commonality of their experience makes it intriguing to me and I'm looking forward to see how this develops in season 2."
4591,Science,I am a nurse working in hospice. There are people I know who by the paradigms of even five years ago would have probably been in hospice care by now. But they are getting a new lease on life through immunotherapy. I thank Dr. Gandhi and her colleagues. 
4592,Science,"Big Pharma is investing so much in research to protract for a few months the lives of cancer patients.<br/>So many new drugs are lately coming on the market and are being widely publicized on television promising miracles .<br/>I am for serious research aiming at cure and real prolonged survival of patients.<br/>When research only objective is pecuniary, I am skeptical, also because very few patients will be able to afford the new therapies and health insurers will try to deny payments for theses new drugs .<br/>More emphasis , more regulations and  more investment should be put in prevention and on making therapies already available more affordable.<br/>Letâs not forget the recent scandals of so many â old drugs â whose price has been astronomically increased by unscrupulous predatory practices of Big Pharma . Remember epinephrine pen for example ......"
4593,Science,"The findings of the study are incredibly exciting and represent the advancement of biologic and immunotherapy and modern medicine.  However, the key part of the study that is not emphasized as much in this article is the importance of the âmedian survivalâ but also mean survival, the latter of which are not mentioned.  All the study tells us is that 20% more people survived to 10 months when taking the drug at a cost of $100,000 a year.  If follow up shows the drug results in only several extra months of life, the quality of which are lower due to increased side effects, we have to ask ourselves if the billions of dollars spent on this drug are really worth it.<br/>Nearly all other first world countries use cost-effectiveness in deciding whether to pay for a drug, however the FDA does not. This is one often â ignored reason that our healthcare is so much more expensive.  Many studies talk about âstatistically significant increases in survivalâ when the actual increases are only several months.  We never ask ourselves, âwhat is the worth Of a month, or a year, of human lifeâ when making healthcare decisions because this is obviously a very uncomfortable question.<br/>I truly hope that these drugs result in truly significant increases in long term survival, however, I also wish that more attention would be paid to what we are actually getting for our money."
4594,Science,"I am an 11 year survivor of Stage 4 NSCLC.  I had a craniotomy (to remove the mets to my brain), chemo and radiation that miraculously chased my cancer into hiding.  Since I had platinum based chemo, I can never have it again, so look forward to an alternative therapy if it comes back.<br/><br/>I am sad reading some of these comments, that the stigma surrounding this disease is still so high.  I've lost both smoking and non-smoking family members to this disease.  20% of those affected are never smokers.  A large percentage (like myself) are former smokers.  Consider that many boomers smoked in as young adult lives, quit and went on to live a healthy lifestyle, only to be struck down with this awful disease 20 years later.  And then have people dismiss your suffering because they consider it ""self-inflicted"".   <br/><br/>I am happy that some new therapies are being developed.  This cancer is more deadly but receives less funding than colon, breast, pancreatic and prostate cancers combined.    I am hopeful that at some point the research and funding will become more balanced, and that the stigma is lifted."
4595,Science,"I would be a memory now if it were not for the willingness of my doctor at Yale to fight to get me on immunotherapy for my high mutational load uterine cancer over two years ago, after cytotoxins failed.   There have been many side effects but they are manageable. Other comments that mention the need for tumor testing to help determine potential effectiveness are correct.  And community based physicians need to study up on side effects, they mimic other conditions.  To those doctors, DON'T rely on pharma dog and pony shows to get your CME on this."
4596,Science,But he declined even the traditional drugs for some other process.
4597,Science,"You are correct that the first, PD-1 Inhibitors like Keytruda were approved in 2014. However, another immunotherapy Ipillumab, a CTLA-4 inhibitor, was approved in 2011 and has been in trials since 2008. PD-1 inhibitors are much more effective and work in a higher number of people which is why there has been so much press about them over the last 4 years as compared to Ipillumab. "
4598,Science,"""Surgery got all the cancer""? It is a little more complex than that. After surgery the medic team analyzed the tumor and out of 12 lymph nodes 2 had metastasis. Hence the oncologist said the recurrence probability was 30% with no chemo and a *wonderful* 20% with chemo. Thanks to Nobel prize winning Otto von Warburg who discovered cancer cells need glucose to survive and cannot use fat, as healthy cells can do, and since my keto diet kept my blood glucose around 70 mg/dL, the way forward seemed clear. To summarize: cancer cells can only use glucose, healthy cells can use both glucose and fat. Guess it is not surprising there is a lot of cancer considering the typical diet full of sugar. Plus type 2 diabetes. Plus all the other metabolic diseases."
4599,Science,afaik most small cell lung cancers are caused by tobacco.  Not so sure about non-small.

4603,Metro,"How long before Twitter Twit Trump derides Judge Wood in an early morning Twitter attack. He shows absolutely no respect for the law in this country, the fact that Judge Wood has an impeccable jurist history counts for nothing for âourâ President, this bully knows that Judge Wood will not be able to fight back. "
4604,Metro,"So now a plausibly criminal conspiracy believes it should decide which documents may not be seen by prosecutors, when one of the conspirators is president of the country?"
4605,Metro,"Going down the list of possible Special Masters to handle the Trump / Cohen documents seized, the reputations, qualification of each candidate are being weighed by Judge Wood.  After consulting the list supplied by President Trump's lawyers, she has selected the best possible overseer for the case.  Ted Nugent."
4606,Metro,"Trump has always sought daily coverage by the NY Times and in a 'be careful what you wish for' moment come true -he has it.  While he may have dreamed of coverage of his stellar business skills, what he's gotten instead is fact based coverage the federal criminal investigation of the legitimacy of his office. <br/><br/>Schadenfreude on steroids.  Popcorn please!"
4607,Metro,Remember Nixonâs âmissingâ 18 minutes? I wonder what equivalent Trump could cook up if he were given access to these materials??!
4608,Metro,One wonders how much tax has gone unpaid on all the hush money Cohen has distributed over the years.
4609,Metro,No worries. Trump will pardon all of his minions in due time.
4610,Metro,"Dear President Trump you may have thought you could bend the truth to fit your warped sense of what that truth is, and I will give you credit you have done an impressive job of this with Fox News and the Republicans. But the federal judiciary is not going to be as easy as Hannity and Fox and friends. <br/><br/>These are people who have spent their entire adult lives in service of the truth and the rule of law, unlike you they are rule followers, you sir have met your match."
4611,Metro,"...just for the sake of accuracy, the Stormy Daniels thing should be called a sexual encounter rather than an affair."
4612,Metro,If these people are allowed to review the materials seized; they will know what not to lie and what facts can be stretched in future interview.
4613,Metro,"Edward Coke spoke of ""The gladsome light of jurisprudence.""  Trump, Cohen, Hannity and their blind or greed-driven sycophants may try to extinguish that light, but it still shines, given the chance.  Now let's be sure the light is not permitted to dim.  It is our only way out of this mess."
4614,Metro,All systems go!<br/><br/>Mueller should present Phase I of the case to Rosenstein by early late spring- OBSTRUCTION.  <br/><br/>Phase II - Collusion.  This will be complete by  November.  Timing works perfect with a Democrat takeover in the House and SENATE.  Impeachment and removal by January.<br/><br/>Phase III- Financial Crimes. Mueller didn't hire the best financial crimes prosecutors to review NDAs. Donald Trump is in the belly of the beast.  <br/><br/>No one escapes the Trump administration unscathed...not even Donald!
4615,Metro,"Trump hired Cohen to shield and protect him from crimes.<br/><br/>Therefore the exception to attorney-client privilege applies, and such privilege does not exist."
4616,Metro,"By the end of this, at least many folks now yelling, ""Atty.-client privilege"", will finally learn what that means. It's not nearly as broad as these folks, now yelling, seem to believe it is. Or put another way, just because a person is an Atty., does not mean, everything spoken to him/her, is somehow protected by A-C Priv."
4617,Metro,Thank thank you Judge Wood.
4618,Metro,"Upon filing the motion both Trump's and Cohen's lawyers should have submitted a ""privilege log"" in which one or the other laid out the files, or portions of  files, that either or both deemed to be privileged, rather than claim that he had ""a thousand"" clients.  Why would a judge trust the legal team(s) that, like their client(s),  have (has) so little respect for the truth? "
4619,Metro,"Well, this answers the Trump ""Where's my Roy Coen"" interrogative; the Judge should just legally remove the silent ""h"" from ""Coehn"" and Trump would have his Coen resurrected. "
4620,Metro,"Watch Sean Hannity, Jeanine Pirro, Laura Inghram, Jesse Watters, Steve Doocey,  Brian Kilmeade, Tucker Carlson, and others to begin a character assassination of Judge Kimba Wood."
4621,Metro,"A federal democratic party registered Judge Kimba Wood in NY appointed by Reagan has violated Trump's right to review the seized material. The most powerful world leader is not allowed due process in his own country. This will justify any legal response that Trump can think of. There is a bipartisan consensus that the FBI director James Comey should have been fired during the Obama years and the firing of Comey by Trump was justified. Although I do not think that Trump should fire Mueller who seems to have opened a can of worms that are wiggling out of control but if he does decide to do it for good legal reasons he will be justified in doing so, Even mass killers have greater rights than Trump and his lawyers. Trump called the FBI raid on his lawyer ""disgraceful"". It is gone beyond that and it is now disgusting.  "
4622,Metro,"Paranoid baloney. Trump's the current world heavyweight champion big baby: when something doesn't go his way, he always cries ""IT'S NOT FAIR!!!"" to deflect, change the subject, and weasel out of responsibility. He's been doing it his whole life, by all reports, and had graduate training from the legendarily evil Roy Cohn. The real question is, is the evidence unimpeachable? We'll see. Trump's version of the old saying is ""if facts are against you, and the law is against you, attack the judge, the prosecutors, the media, and the Clintons."" <br/><br/>The judge has every right to say she trusts the prosecutors' office, based on her experience, and neither Trump nor Cohen has raised any claim against the prosecutors' integrity; the judge is nonetheless still considering taking the totally extraordinary extra step of bringing in an independent special master to support the appearance of fairness. You not only have no beef, it's both dishonest and ludicrous for you to pretend you do. You're spinning imaginary baloney from thin air.<br/><br/>I'm waiting for someone to demand Wood recuse herself because, as a well-known misogynist, Trump can't get a fair trial from a woman judge. "
4623,Metro,"My reaction also.  Also, what's his specialty?  Facilitating payment of hush money?"
4624,Metro,"The $130,000 to buy Ms. Daniels silence was  funded by a home equity loan taken by Mr. Cohen. If he lied about this purpose in applying for the loan, that's considered bank fraud, a federal crime."
4625,Metro,"Yes, she is a porn star, but it is a legal profession and she is not on trial...."
4626,Metro,Pence will be unable to make State charges go away. And New York seems to be hard on his trail.
4627,Metro,"I appreciate your good humor, John, but I'm not conceding ""there's nothing going on here but a fishing expedition."" You can be sure that virtually no New Yorker believes Trump doesn't have decades of dirty (criminal) secrets. He has devoted his life to the professional practice of getting away with anything and everything, as tutored by Roy Cohn. Why do you think the city of New York as a whole voted for Hillary at the rate of 82%? <br/><br/>And it's way too late to call this a ""fishing expedition."" When Cohen sued Stormy, he, no doubt inadvertently, opened the floodgates. There's raw sewage and dead fish floating on the surface, stinking to heaven. At this point the prosecutors would be committing malfeasance not to proceed with the case.<br/><br/>lotusflower0 is confused, sorry -- SDNY is a Federal jurisdiction and Kimba Wood is a Federal judge; there are no NYS charges or proceedings we know of, not yet. Even if Trump somehow blocks the Feds and the criminal case goes to the State courts, which is possible, and Cynthia Nixon defeats Andrew Cuomo for governor, which I'm not sure is possible, I still can't imagine Ms. Nixon, a liberal Democrat, would be inclined to pardon Trump, but maybe you know something the rest of us don't, John. "
4628,Metro,"Oh, nonsense. She was just saying she wasn't thinking about appointing a special master because she didn't trust the prosecutors, who usually manage the sorting out of legitimately privileged information, but just to do whatever was needed to maintain the appearance of fairness. This is a totally bogus complaint."
4629,Metro,I'll try not to hold it against Kimba.
4630,Metro,"It may be that Kimba presides over the unravelling of this President. If that is the case, expect her, and Kimba SA, to become part of history."
4631,Metro,Good point.
4632,Metro, There are so many documents that I doubt that they  have them memorized.  
4633,Metro,"I wonder if Cohen will be the first of Trump's cronies to flee to a foreign land to avoid investigation, testifying, and going to jail.   Since he's not under arrest, I imagine he still has his passports (unlike Manafort.) "
4634,Metro,"I was being sarcastic, in case you did not get it."
4635,Metro,"@RNS - If Cohen actually acted on behalf of Trump without his knowledge (unlikely), then Cohen's $130,000 payment could be considered an illegal campaign contribution."

4643,Well,This article did not pay off the title and provided zero new insights on statins. I would love for this article to be rewritten and actually articulate the Pro's and Cons.
4644,Well,"Tried statins three different times over the past ten years and the results were always the sameâdebilitating muscle aches and muscle atrophy. They may work for others, but they are poison to me.<br/><br/>I lowered my cholesterol by becoming a vegan, losing weight and exercising more."
4645,Well,"I don't take a statin any longer, but I've often wondered if it gave me an irreversible side effect of ""gas"".   Any ideas on that?"
4646,Well,This article appears courtesy of Big Pharma.
4647,Well,"Thank very much, Jane! My reservation regarding statins has to do with loss of libido (quite unlikely for most folks). As an alternative I take over 700 mgs of Fish Oil every other day. At 79 I cannot do without sex!"
4648,Well,"Of major importance here and with any drug is that over 90% is now funded by the drug companies producing the drugs. How can you possibly get reliable and honest data from them?<br/><br/>I totally agree with Working Mama - the side effects are minimized by doctors who prescribe the drugs and of far more relevance to anyone seriously considering them.<br/><br/>Of importance also is that doctors do not look for the cause in the rise of cholesterol, nor understand the basic operations of the sympathetic nervous system, which actually controls the functions of much of the body. Cholesterol is necessary for a number of those functions and an extreme rise in its production is not a symptom to be controlled, but an indicator of a issue needing to be addressed.  "
4649,Well,"Not only do patients lack the knowledge regarding probabilities and relative risks, many physicians do not as well.  My mother, who is 79, was prescribed a statin because of a modestly elevated LDL.  There is absolutely zero reason to put someone that old on a statin, especially with a minor risk for heart disease.  Physicians often do not think about the implications of prescribing another drug let alone have the time to discuss the side effects."
4650,Well,One of the things that caught my attention was a recent study where the percentage of people taking the placebo who reported muscle pain was the same as those taking the statin.  Even some cholesterol skeptics see the value of a low dose statin for those of us with risk factors.  I take 5mg 3 times a week and so far so good.
4651,Well,I cannot believe people still fall for the âcholesterol is badâ myth and allow big pharma to abuse them.
4652,Well,"World Health Organization has proven every person taking statins for decades still had heart attacks! It prevents nothing and there's no correlation with cholesterol levels and heart problems!<br/><br/>Prove your thinking with world-renowned non-pharmaceutical paid studies.

4653,Well,"As the 2016 JAMA review you quote concluded, people with little risk should avoid unnecessary prevention strategies.  "
4654,Well,"I had a heart attack 20 years ago. No second one since. I started statins. Then guidelines for ""acceptable"" LDL levels changed, I was pushed to maximum dosage. I lost my ability to walk without pain. From running three to five miles several times a week, I could no longer walk half a mile without pain.<br/><br/>Did the statin prevent a subsequent event? I don't know its contribution. But maybe it was the changes to my diet, or the bypass, five years later, or weight loss, or riding my bike. I don't know. I changed a lot.<br/><br/>But I am pretty certain that statin drug overdoses to achieve very low LDL levels were the cause of my irreversible loss of leg function. When I cut back on statin dosage (against medical advice) my glucose levels were no longer  ""prediabetic.""<br/><br/>I suggest great care in accepting the currently trendy pressure to take statins. Those having heart attacks--not even a majority of them have elevated LDL's. When I asked about having a heart attack although my LDL levels were not very high, my cardiologist at the time said, ""If you had a heart attack, your LDL's were too high, no matter what they were."" That means that there's no predictive value to that number. "
4655,Well,And they have saved thousands of lives. The literature on on this subject is incontrovertible if one has read and understood it. Too many well designed convincing trials to quote here<br/>No drug or treatment is perfect. But statins are among the great beneficial breakthroughs of the last 40 years.
4656,Well,"Why should I believe your âexpertâ opinion is the right one? My grandfather died of strokes, my dad did too and my sister had a stroke (from which she fully recovered) when she was 51. Only my sister (of the three) was unhealthy and overweight. I am in good shape, exercise, never smoked, donât drink and eat fairly well (lots of veggies, not too many refined carbs). I have low BP but genetic high triglycerides plus hyperlipidemia and low HDL. Iâm taking my statins thanks all the same. One size does not fit all. "
4657,Well,"@Dr. J:<br/>Cholesterol has _never_ been demonstrated to _cause_ heart disease. Not dietary cholesterol, and not blood serum cholesterol. Your vegan group-think tells us that ""cholesterol must be bad because it's in animal foods"".<br/><br/>Any diet that cuts sugars and refined carbs improves lipid profiles, regardless of whether or not it is plant-based."
4658,Well,"Julie,  never too late;  get her out on a putting green or driving range."
4659,Well,"For heaven's sake, don't take the statins,and keep doing all the good things you are doing! "
4660,Well,"Yes, I am actually a clinical neuropsychologist and considered the possibility of psychological explanations in my case (it would be the nocebo effect in my case, not placebo, since the effects were negative).  But actually I did not initially make any reasoned connection between the statin and my decreased mood and energy. I went months wondering why I was suddenly so much more fatigued and feeling down.  It was only after doing some unrelated research into statins that I realized some of the atypical side effects of atorvastatin could be just what I had been dealing with: Depression and fatigue.  I went off, and the symptoms stopped.  I also was found to have exceptionally low vitamin D levels and never-before pre-diabetic levels of glucose.  Now, were the biomarkers of medication side-effects also nocebo? No.  At some point we need to be willing to acknowledge that there are true side effects to medications that alter our physiological functioning. Be careful about pharma wanting to attribute all good outcomes to their products, and all bad outcomes to....nocebo.  Not everything is due to psychology alone.  And keep in mind, I say this, reluctantly, as a psychologist.   "
4661,Well,"The study discussed in this article is about reading AND playing with children. While Iâd never argue against the value of reading, (I was read to nightly growing up and read to my children daily/nightly and I love to read) I donât understand why play was left out of the title. I find this misleads what the study explored: the value of connection with parents / social emotional development. Iâd be curious with the study were every done with play alone and reading alone."
4662,Well,"I am continually amazed at the contemporary belief that one needs a study to validate the obvious.  <br/><br/>On the other hand, as nursery schools and kindergartens have drastically reduced their free imaginative play time as well as read-aloud time from teachers and aides, I suppose these kinds of stuies are needed to push childhood back into something approaching normalcy.  <br/><br/>Reading to our children, spending time with our children in their imaginative play (however boring it may seem to us), and being outdoors with children WITHOUT being on a cell phone or scrolling through who knows what can only benefit the emotional development of any child.  There is no substitute for being fully present in the life of another human being."
4663,Well,"While I've been reading Fielding's Joseph Andrews every page makes me think how good it would be read aloud to children, something that it was not written as but today the saucy and wildly ridiculous wouldn't be perfect as well as the olde English."
4664,Well,"Well yes, duh, of course. Reading and creative play are essential for child development and are also one of the great joys of parenting and grandparentimg. But we all know that. I canât imagine a pediatrician or other health care or professional who works with children and families who doesnât.  Iâd prefer to see scarce resource dollars (governmental and private) be used to support research on less obvious child development questions and on service delivery. "
4665,Well,"Every night until middle school, we read out loud.  As a family: cat curled up on the bed, dog on the floor next to the bed, both parents taking turns reading.  Our son loved the time together.  When friends would visit they would do the reading.<br/>We moved from ""Goodnight Moon"" to ""The Lord of the Rings"" by the end.<br/>There is nothing more important for you child, whether a single parent household or a two parent household, then eating the evening meal together when possible and reading out loud.  "
4666,Well,"We read to our kids every night.<br/>It was an important time to reflect and discuss our day, our fears, our excitement but most of all explore the exciting world of bedtime stories and the characters adventures. Through these characters we explored important moral and ethical questions.<br/>For parents who are concerned about our current environmental crisis and the lack of educational opportunities available to parents and teachers to instill in our children the need to care for our natural environment please read a beautiful new book just out about this very topic. <br/><br/>Beasts at Bedtime:Revealing the Environmental Wisdom in Childrenâs Literature<br/><br/>The author Liam Heneghan gives us new insights into classic childrenâs literatureâs profound messages about our environment. The wisdom is already there in the stories, we just need to look carefully. Bedtime is a good time to explore those themes with kids. A timely book. "
4667,Well,Love it!
4668,Well,"I teach kindergarten; your observations are 1,000% correct."

What he meant was that the more distressing the reality or truth is, the greater the lengths people will go to defend against knowing or acknowledging it.  I hope you can take some small comfort in knowing that the hate you have encountered is, in some way an indication of how deeply you touched your white readers, and how desperately some needed to defend against acknowledging their own guilt and shame.  It is, I think, your love that cuts so deeply.  Your writing brought tears to my eyes.  To give that kind of gift takes courage, and to acknowledge our racism and sexism takes courage as well.  As a white person I find it a relief to see the true catastrophe and acknowledge my complicity in it (my privilege, my inherent racism).  It is exhausting and painful but it is a gift too.  I am so sorry that you have been attacked in this way.  I hope that you know that the voices of those that can't bear knowing may be the loudest, but they can't drown out the truth."

4673,Learning,In this picture I see two women looking at the moss and feeling it. I think they might be some kind of scientists that go out and explore all different plants and where they grow. They also have a basket so maybe they are collecting the moss ad taking it back to a lab and they are going to study it. Maybe itâs a type of moss that slowly kills trees and they are going to see why.  
4674,Learning,"In this picture, there are two people with a basket in some sort of forest. Especially looking in and on the tree for something you can't normally find in cities. What makes me say that is because I can infer that they're looking really hard for something. I can also find that the tree they're on has fallen down."
4675,Learning,"Two tree hugging vegans congregate at a mossy tree, taking samples of moss they will then test to see if it can be used as an edible substance because let's face it, the vegans are taking over! "
4676,Learning,Two nature scientists are picking up samples from a fallen tree in the forest. I think this because they have a basket they could use to carry around the samples and the woman both look intelligent. They could also be simply having a picnic if you donât look into it as much. 
4677,Learning,In this picture there are two old ladies about in there 50s.They are looking or studying something. you can't really tell what they're looking at maybe an animal or some type of plant. They Also have a basket with food im guessing .<br/>I see the two old ladies staring at something with amazed faces . The plants around the are dying so It might be winter . The old ladies also have big sweaters on so that implies that its cold. Their baskets seem to be full as well with some goodies or objects .<br/>Maybe the baskets are for carrying things that they find or picking from the woods . as they walked they saw a rare plant so they are admiring its beauty. it looks like it just rained because of the moss trees to. 
4678,Learning,It appears like the two females are taking a close observation to the fallen tree that is covered in moss. 
4679,Learning,two people are in the forest examining a fallen tree and the women seem to be looking very closely to the tree. i think that in the picnic basket there are some samples of whatever they're collecting or examining.
4680,Learning,"It seems as though they are studying the moss on the fallen tree, i say this because of the way they are examining the moss. Either that or they may be having some type of picnic because of the baskets they have brought along with them and the clothes they are wearing seem to be more casual than experimental. "
4681,Learning,Two women are in the woods with their baskets and they think that in one of them baskets and something weird. Maybe you got an animal in the bag and they want to find out what it is but the safest thing is that they have food in the basket and they put them in a comfortable place to eat.
4682,Learning,i believe that they are looking for plant life such as the moss. Only because they have gloves and supplies.
4683,Learning,I believe that the people in the picture are collecting moss for research since they have gloves in their basket and they look like they're looking at the tree intently and the tree is covered in moss.
4684,Learning,looks like they are looking for some information.
4685,Learning,"The women seem to be looking at the moss that has grown on a fallen tree. Based on the body language of the women,  it seems the two have found something interesting. There are two black wicker baskets in the picture, one that is resting on the tree and happens to block whatever the women are looking at from view.  The other is next to the blonde womanâs leg. In the baskets, there are plastic bags, and thick gloves, which could be used to take samples of the moss for some sort of test. Thus, I think the women are possibly scientists studying something that is related to moss. Possibly, they are doing research or collecting samples about how fast the moss grows, as it usually takes a large amount of time."
4686,Learning,"In the photo, there are two people with a brownish basket, leaning on a downed, mossey tree. They might be collecting stuff."
4687,Learning,They are two women from different racial ethnicity. Which are somewhere in the woods collecting some sort of organic specimen for a homemade solution. Since they are not scientist since the basket is not a professional transportation device as well as them not wearing a uniform with safety tools. It looks like a typical hike in the woods during fall.
4688,Learning,To me the people in the picture are trying to remake the Wizard Of Oz. They are remaking the part where she goes through the woods with her basket and her little dog Toby. The editors and directors are shooting where she goes over a stump and maybe she drops her basket and that's why one is sitting on the stump.
4689,Learning,In this picture you see two women that are stranded in the woods. They are searching for supplies to use to survive. They come across a dead tree that is now growing moss and decide to take the moss and squeeze it to get the water out for hydration. 
4690,Learning,"i think that to ladies found an abandoned basket in the woods, so they are checking it out."
4691,Learning,"This picture is about a basket that was left in the woods and the two women found it.The basket was filled with a map of the old civilization and spices for food.The spices were Ginger, Pepper, Basil, and Cloves.All of the spices combined make the perfect recipe for french toast.The french toast was so good people would  go crazy for it.Some people went on a rampage for it they would burn down villages.Someone went to destroy the remaining spices and went to sleep under the tree  and sat their basket on the tree.When she woke up it was dark and she decided to go find the next village over and lost her way back."
4692,Learning,"These two people are scientists. The lady is British and the man is Japanese. They are exploring the woods of Japan. They found this fallen tree and decided to figure out how old the tree is and how it fell. They are using the tools in the basket, which are on the tree, to figure out the tree's age and how it fell."
4693,Learning,"This is a phtoo of two women by a fallen tree that has a basket lying on top of it.  The women seem to be inspecting the tree, so it is likely that they are collecting something and putting it into the basket.  Maybe they are doing some sort of scientific research and they are storing their specimens in the basket. "
4694,Learning,There are two woman sitting near a tree that has fallen over and has been overgrown with moss. They seem to be collecting samples of fungi or moss and the basket seems to contain plastic bags to contain those samples. I think they are scientists. 
4695,Learning,"In this picture, two women may be collecting samples of moss or fungus on a fallen tree trunk in the forest.  They brought two baskets with them.  The basket on the ground has plastic bags in it, which could be used to collect samples for further research.  The other basket contains what appear to be blankets and papers, which could possibly have information about forest moss or fungi on them.  The two women seem to be dressed appropriately for forest climate, so they were most likely there on purpose and not just strolling along.   The research that they are performing could concern the effects of moss and fungi on the environment, or they could be discovering a new species possibly."
4696,Learning,"The ladies are sitting down in the woods,staring at a picnic basket. I think the basket was there before they got there,so they don't know who left it or why its there.The lady in the black jacket and glasses is reaching to see whats inside to make sure nothing bad is inside. "
4697,Learning,"In this photo, there are two women that seem to be scientists.  It looks like they are getting a sample of something in the woods, possibly the moss on the tree.  They have a basket which looks like supplies to obtain and hold the substance they are getting.  This photo takes place in fall.  I can tell because the trees are bare and there are leaves have changed color and are on the ground.  The women are dressed in warm clothes so the weather is probably a bit chilly.  "
4698,Learning,"In this picture it seems as if two biologists are collecting sample of the plant life or surveying the state of the forest. The two people are of two different ethnicity, one is Asian while the other is European. It seems as if it might rain soon, as the background looks cloudy and humid. The tree they're surveying is mossy as well and the season appears to be autumn."
4699,Learning,"In the image there is two older ladies who seem to be observing an uprooted tree that is covered in moss. They both have baskets, maybe filled with supplies or tools to help with their observations."
4700,Learning,"In this picture we see two colleagues who appear to be inspecting a tree. Based on the way they are looking at the tree they could be scientists or environmentalists gathering information on this seemingly dead (based on the fact that it's downed) yet very alive (lots of moss growing on it) tree. Another theory would be, based on the picnic baskets that they could be on some sort of hike about to eat lunch, but this is quite unlikely due to the fact that neither one of them has a hiking pack."
4701,Learning,I think these two women are biologists studying the moss on the tree. This is apparent because there are some plastic bags which might be used for the collection of samples and for testing for certain substances on the moss. There is also what appears to be a spare pair of boots or gloves which could help for the collection of samples or for walking in nature.
4702,Learning,This looks like that these 2 women are having a picnic on this old tree. This tree could have been the same one a long time ago when they were kids and when they had their first picnic.                       
4703,Learning,"I think that two women are in a forest with a basket, they might be studying moss or maybe how the tree how the fell. if the are doing this they could be collecting samples of moss to send to a lab it looks like it could be autumn in north America maybe. "
4704,Learning," This picture looks like this woman is having a picnic with another woman. And it also seems like they are having it in a fallen tree. My question is ""why are they having a picnic in that fallen tree""?."
4705,Learning,"I think that these people are studing the moss on the tree.  What makes me belive this is that they are looking at the tree and have a basket that seems to be filled with tools.  Another idea is that they are having a picnic in the woods, I think this because of the basket."
4706,Learning," In the photo, it looks like there are two ladies who are some kind of scientist in the woods examining a tree that fell down. But they are not just looking at the tree they are investigating the moss looking stuff on the tree because the stuff that looks like moss isn't really moss and they're trying to find out what it really is."
4707,Learning,I think what is going on in this picture is the two females set out to go into the woods to look for maybe a new species or a type of organism. There also appears to be moss all over the bark of the trees. They might be taking a sample to go back to their lab with afterwards. The setting seems to be in a forest somewhere in Asia or an English speaking country maybe.  
4708,Learning,in the photo the people seem to be dressed for the occasion of walking through the woods with their ran coats and boots. The objects in the picture are a fallen tree covered in moss and a basket that the people must've brought with them from what i can see it looks like the basket may be filled with papers. The setting of this photo is a somewhat dense wooded area where it seems a lot of trees have fallen. The engagement between the two people and the tree is the people are looking and the moss covering the tree. I think the relationship between the people could be their jobs that have something to do with trees . 
4709,Learning,where are they? interesting perspective 
4710,Learning,What makes you think that? I think it would be hard for them to be able to take care of the tree since two people wouldn't be able to lift the tree and the tree appears to be rotting so it's probably dead already.
4711,Learning,I agree with you! This picture does seem like it's been photo shopped. I even think this might be a seen off of a movie. I think this because it kind of reminded me of the little red ridding hood. There's a grandma that seems to be with her daughter and they are carrying baskets. The setting is also perfect because that seems like a place where there might be a wolf. I wonder why they are dressed so fancy in a place like that? I can see the grandma might be wearing boots with heels and the daughter seems to have some leather leggings on. 
4712,Learning,"I agree, however the moss canÂ´t be radioactive because the ladies are touching it. You can definitely spot the light of a flash on the baskets and also the the womanÂ´s   pants. The woman can be investigating how that much moss was able to grow on the tree, because it is pretty  hard to find it."
4713,Learning,I think they are actually collecting moss samples from the tree. They have the basket to carry some of the moos and parts of the actual tree. This appears to be a tree not broccoli 
4714,Learning,I agree that this photo could be photoshopped because the leaves have a certain glare and the women are strangely positioned. I believe that this photo was taken for an advertisement or a magazine. It is clear that the two women are examining the moss on the tree which makes me think this photo could be taken for a science magazine. 
4715,Learning,Thanks for commenting @Hailey c! What do you see that makes you say this is set in a remote location? That this basket was there before their arrival? Tell us more and remember to provide evidence for your ideas!
4716,Learning,"@Aley thanks for contributing to the image discussion this morning! Your comments sound like they are focusing on the two figures in this image, noticing their gaze and facial expressions and considering their profession. You're even thinking of what we are not seeing in this image, the absence of other people. <br/><br/>What more can we find?"
4717,Learning,how do you know are you a cartographer???????
4718,Learning,Good guess! How do you know they are having a picnic in the woods? Do you see food somewhere? 
4719,Learning,Is it possible that they could be botanists? 
4720,Learning,Hi @Leo thanks for contributing your ideas and background knowledge to this conversation. What do you see that makes you say these figures are from this area? 
4721,Learning,Could be early spring.  
4722,Learning,@Ebrecke547339 has noticed that the figures seem to be dressed for rainy weather. Is there evidence that it recently rained? Or will rain soon?
4723,Travel,"Beautiful pictures Mr Haslam.<br/>But looking at those balconies filled with gullible tourists while hanging over the packed stands, one just has to cringe at the terrible danger if there is ever even a minor earthquake during that time. It is, after all a very earthquake prone country.<br/>I once had that same feeling of dread while sitting in  a unmoving traffic jam on the Frisco Bay bridge. A mere week later, on of those sections dropped during a devastating quake."
4724,Travel,"I love Siena.  But despite the melodramatic romanticization of the author, the horse race should be left in the past.  It is dangerous and traumatizing for the horses.  We have to start showing some empathy for animals, instead of using them for our own pleasure whenever we want."

4728,Travel,"I enjoyed dinner in the Piazza Publico a month after the 2015 race.  Our hosts described the frenzy/chaos/excitement in a way that mirrors the photos included here.  Then we walked to the contrade of the August winner, to see their banner and their put-downs of the also-rans.  But I think thatâs as close as I ever want to come to experiencing Paleo...itâs a bit like New Yearâs Eve in Time Square, which is to say something for the young [at heart].  Certainly not for the crowd-phobic. "
4729,Travel,"Siena, even without the Palio, pure Tuscany.  My favorite city in Italy.  Visiting a few of the different contradas, to see their history, is a great way to understand Northern Italy.  "
4730,Travel,"I attended a Medieval joust in Arezzo, near Siena, back in the 90's.  Basically identical to this but with pikes and jousting dummies.  It was an all day affair, beginning with watching the contradas march into town, chanting, drumming tossing flags high into the air.  Later in the piazza, the contradas staked out homes all around the square, 3 and 4 stories high, and taunted each other with banners and song.  By the time the joust began there were 2 busloads of carabinieri in riot gear standing by, just off the piazza.  It was the most intense sporting event I've ever been to.  Just an unforgettable day, full of color and sound and sweat.  If you can make it to Arezzo or Siena for one of these, do it!"
4731,Travel,I love Siena and can't wait to go back.  I just wish they stopped the horse race.  It is cruel.  Can't they use hippy hop balls or something?
4732,Travel,"You have glorified and made exciting the story of animal abuse, pure and simple.  You write :""During the race, jockeys take their lives into their hands. ""<br/>That is the jockeysâ own choice!  ""The race involves three clockwise laps around one-third-of-a-mile track and there are tight turns. There have been dozens of serious injuries; videos of spills are all over YouTube. Horses are more vulnerable. More than 50 have died in these races since 1970; animal rights protesters have staged repeated protests.""  Many more horses than the 50, I assure you, die later from  agonizing internal or external injuries,  I promise you this.   And, might you please explain what happens to these horses who are seriously injured either during or, as often happens, afterwards from having been in race?  (Many die afterwards from being pushed beyond endurance. The lungs bleed, the horse collapses later, etc.)  Why don't you finish your horrible story and tell it all?  Please write about the selfishness and cruelty. The callousness.  How the badly injured horses are sent alive to a slaughterhouse, many, if not euthanized on the spot, how they are cut short to a few years on this earth (most are young, well under 10 years, often only 3 or 4 years old,  and a horse should live to over 30)?  Doesn't this bother you?  You should hang your head in shame. ""Last August, I finally witnessed this spectacle, the worldâs greatest horse race, for myself.

When Panama Papers can be revealed,why not tricks in sports - horse racing,bull fighting,or cock fighting among others?  Those who come to watch such sports are real fools.  Or is it human psychology,to watch such sports?  Jockeys bribing each other - sounds interesting.  In India,gambling is not allowed,but horse racing is allowed.  Strange.  "
4734,Travel,The tower of PALIO DI SIENNA is a remarkable building worth learning about<br/>how is was constructed and what keeps it from falling underneath all those bricks.
4735,Travel,This is what all sport's contests should be; honest in their dishonesty!  The illusion of fairness be damned!!  Let foul play rule and you'll have the ultimate fairness!!

4737,Travel,"Horse racing is barbaric. When oh when will horses get liberated from humans? One would think motorized vehicles would have liberated them from us, but no, we had to condemn them to HUMAN racing spectacles of drunkenness and gambling. Spare me the âbut theyâre treated so well!â Horses are killed on racetracks around the world every day, just one part of the myriad injustices they suffer. Wake up people and evolve!"

4739,Travel,"Iâve been to Siena, not for the Palio, and was amazed at how small the square is and it slopes too."
4740,Travel,"A few summers ago when my husband and I were visiting Siena, we walked outside and below the city walls and with a few others, watched a falconry demonstration. Watching the birds released and circling down from the walls high above us silhouetted against a brilliant blue sky was breathtaking. The respect and affection that the head falconer - a tall, older gentleman who had the bearing and profile of a latter day Medici- showed when he talked about, spoke to, and caressed his returning birds was clear. We were entranced.<br/><br/>That afternoon had none of the noise, âblood, sweat, and tearsâ ( and cruelty) of the Palio, but it was certainly equally magical."
4741,Travel,"The Palio, like Thoroughbred racing is simply a cruel and unjust use of horses and should be banned forever."
4742,Travel,"In early October, at the start of white truffle season, the town of Alba does it's counterprogramming to Siena, with a donkey race around the town square.  Equally outrageous, riotous and no-holds-barred.  The donkeys are infinitely less cooperative and predictable than horses."

4746,Travel,"The photo by Andy Haslam is outstanding! I lived in Siena for two months after graduating college and then visited the city on our Luna di Miele last summer. My wife and I have named our daughter after this beautiful city.  Tuscany is wonderful but this jewel shines above so many other amazing views.  A word to the wise about attending the Palio if you decide to enter the center of the piazza.: its very hot, packed with people, BYOB but...you can not go to the bathroom, and can not leave the center area until the race is over.  I guarantee you will never forget the experience.  During the race I attended a horse literally crashed and died along the walls, and no one seemed at all surprised nor upset. Be brave, and good luck! "
4747,Travel,"I studied at University of Siena in the summer of 2002 and attended Il Palio with my classmates. We were crammed into the center for hours and the race only lasted a few moments. Happily, the horse representing our contrada won (Contrada Tartuca)! Thanks for the memories."
4748,Travel,i saw this one year in the late 80's when i was lucky enough to do a year abroad in college.  thank you mom and dad!  what a great tradition and these excellent photos do it justice.  
4749,Travel,"Itâs something that itâs something that no one going to Italy should miss, too. This is really how these races, jousting, competitions of all sorts, were conducted all over Europe in the Middle Ages. and it was incredibly fun. The arena is filled with sand and the crowd in the center are as much a part of the spectacle as the riders."
4750,Travel,"We visited and watched the Palio in the 80s. The pageantry was magnificent, as described in the article.<br/>We bought bleacher seats at the last minute and they were in the second row...with no one seated close by...right on the turn before the finish line...best seats!....hmm...<br/>The race was off, with one rider turned backwards at the start. On the far turn a horse fell and slid into the wall. Didn't get up. We were all fixated by that when the leaders came to our turn. Three abreast. Apparently only two can make that turn. The outside horse comes halfway into the stands, hitting my mother as she dodged . The rider was tossed into the stands and was beaten with sticks by his (or another?) contrada's fans and chased onto the track. Seconds later, a riderless horse comes around the track for the third and final time, dodges its former rider and crosses the finish line to win the race.<br/>Chaos, indeed. Unforgettable, beautifully unique chaos!"
4751,Travel,"<br/>I loved the photography  - it was extraordinary.  <br/><br/>I also loved the descriptive phrases: ""pretend youâre visiting a huge outdoor loony binâ and ""If a jockey is thwacked off his mount, his riderless horse can still win on its own, like Garfunkel arriving without Simon.""  So funny and so vivid.<br/><br/>I just worry about the horses.  All those people, the heat, the chaos.  I wouldn't be surprised if some of them kept running even after the race, just to get away from everything and everyone.<br/><br/>Refreshing article.  Thanks for sharing."
4752,Travel,Hey Dwight you had my interest about the race - and then it became a travel brochure of Tuscany. After reading and giving up half way thru I lost interest. For me this was a switch and bait article. 
4753,Travel,"""Horses are more vulnerable. More than 50 have died in these races since 1970."" So bull-fighting is considered unconscionable savagery, but this is described as quaint? <br/><br/>A ""strenuously male and macho"" event, in which horses are viewed as disposable is, quite frankly, contemptible. No amount of colorful costumes can cover it up, any more than decorating circus elephants makes their forced captivity, solely to amuse people, ethical or humane.  "
4754,Travel,Siena had the best pizza in Italy on my visit 20 years ago!
4755,Travel,"Barbaric and needs to end, along with bullfighting. What no one tells you is that multiple horses trip, tumble and break legs racing along the narrow, sharply-cornered streets of Siena, and subsequently must be put down. It's shocking and heartbreaking to see Palio in person, not thrilling."
4756,Travel,"Competitiveness is the root of all moral evil; and it can be argued there are no Italians so vain and chauvinistic as the Sienese (the Florentines are up there, though). Still, their little city is gorgeous, and fun to see come alive with international crowds."
4757,Travel,"nothing in this describes the actual course, which is really steep. no wonder the poor horses die. "
4758,Travel,that steeply sloping main square Piazza del Campo is a unique place to linger - it has magic in it - an amphitheatre for life.
4759,Travel,"I have been to Europe fifteen times, and Siena is my favorite city by far.  None of the crowds of Rome or Florence, no cars in the city center, and great food.  Never been to the Palio di Siena, but have on one occasion taken a day trip, and another time spent three nights there, which I remember as among the best in my life.  The Cathedral is amazing!  It is like walking into a time capsule, practically none of the architecture has changed in 600 years, as no new building was allowed during the Medici reign as they wanted to ensure the hegemony of Florence.  "
4760,Travel,"Italy, its traditions, people, art, food and wine â never fail to put a smile on my face. Evocative writing &amp; wonderful photo essay, grazie mille, NYT! "
4761,Travel,Herman Wouk described this race in his World War II work The Winds of War.
4762,Travel,"Don't watch the race inside the Piazza del Campo if you are in the least bit phobic about crowds. You will barely have enough room to breathe and you will see little of the race itself. But the city is beautiful and the pageantry magnificent, so see that. Skip the race, download a photo and tell your friends and relatives you were there."

Aquila now has the distinction of being called the ""Nonna"" (grandma), because it is the contrada with the longest dry spell since its last victory."

4770,Travel,"NYTcomment, it's not true that a jockey or competitive rider has to whip a horse in order to get him or her to go. I ride every day. I have a hard time holding my horse back when the weather's cool, and he's 23 years old."
4771,Travel,Martha: Thank you. I agree with you.
4772,Travel,"Ehm no...very few accidents in the Palio in Siena. They are of a special cross breed, very tough and raised specialy for these type of races. All the horses that participate are intitled to a pensionary (retirement home) when they end their career or even if they get injured in some other event, rather than being put to sleep, in that case the owners can simply send them to the Siena pensionary where they get healed for free. The average life expectancy for a horse that raced the Palio is 28 years. In America it's twelve..."
4773,Travel,"@symolan.  Actually, to sustain my point, the reference to Switzerland could have easily be removed, but I felt obliged to give the full quote.  Its inclusion makes for a short smile, but it is far from the reality of Switzerland, of which I am a great admirer."
4774,Travel,"Only barely, though ;-)"
4775,Travel,"Seriously? You believe that since the commenter used the word ""thoroughbred"", it is without merit? First of all, he wasn't implying that they used thoroughbreds for this inhumane event. Second, he is correct in his assessment. "
4776,Travel,In the last 74 Palios (since the protocol in defence of the horse was introduced) no horse has been seriously harmed during the Palio. You want to ban horses from running? When you have succeeded maybe you can try prevent kangaroos from jumping.

4786,National,"This is the face of bigotry, and ignorance, willful ignorance no less. While it's nice that as their defense lawyers said, ""no one was physically injured"", well I'm sure that's a small consolation to those who could have been injured. But that doesn't negate their overall plans, to maim and kill, innocent people regardless of the reason. <br/><br/>These people aren't the exception, rather these are probably the norm, or at least the outspoken ones. The rest just skulk around, and cast the ""evil eye"" an any nonwhite person. Pretend that they aren't a bigot.  But these three aren't just talking off the top of their heads, they planned to hurt people are probably would have followed through.<br/><br/>With any luck, they will wind up where they deserve to be, ostracized from society, in prison where a disproportionate number of people of color have been put, for a lot less than threatening to blow people up.  So, maybe they will get some form of justice while sitting in prison, wondering where did their well thought out plan go so wrong, and wonder what kind of society would put whites away for killing an maiming people of color.<br/><br/>A country that believes that all men are created equal, that's kind of a country lock up people like these three. Nevertheless, they will be in good company, while in prison, for what we can only hope is the rest of their lives. "

4789,Science,"Back when I was single a hundred years ago before FB and dating aps, I had become frustrated with my social life, and had a bad year or so of messy relationships and failed friendships. So I made up a few guidelines, so that whenever I met someone I was attracted to I would establish three areas of common interest 1. Did she like to read? Didn't matter what. 2. Did she like or have pets? (Dogs earned the person bonus points) 3. Did she have a sense of humor?  The last could be a little harder to calibrate and generally took some time to research. It wasn't long after that I met my future wife. She easily met my criteria, and I guess, I was able to meet hers. I've been married to her for almost  40 years now.<br/><br/> I wonder what an fMRI would have revealed? "

4796,Science,"""people choose friends who are much like themselves in a wide array of characteristics: of a similar age, race, religion, socioeconomic status, educational level, political leaning, ...""<br/><br/>Why do we have so much trouble accepting this as the basis of racism and the tendency for people to separate into groups? I'm not saying it's right but...<br/><br/>We hear so much about racism and at least categorizing and grouping others/people is a construct (in this paper repeatedly). I've always responded that even in primitive hunter gatherer groups they are aways wary and unliking of the next group just over in the next valley (who often look like them but not enough like them).<br/><br/>I'm not saying we shouldn't rise above these basic impulses but always could see them as stemming from basic human instincts."

Whatever it is thatâs wrong or different about me, though, I canât help feeling that this theory of shared brain waves misses something complex and important in the structure of friendships. Particularly female friendships. And more specifically that notion of looking for a buddy to match either your âpulchritudinousâ or scare-the-horses self. Extremely attractive girls and women often pair with a a BFF who is a little (or a lot) less of everything â less beautiful, less competitive, lower on the social scale. This is true among matriarchal, simian societies as well. Power and status play such a huge part in the forming and maintaining of social alliances. I donât think that aspect can be ignored. <br/><br/>When I see those sloth videos, I am less concerned about the interruption of the symbiotic moth-sloth cycle (maybe the sloths like being clean and fresh, have you considered that?) than I am about the animalsâ exploitation as a tourist draw.

4808,NewsDesk,"Let me help many Times readers understand some context. In many areas highlighted here, these teachers are employees of the âgovernment schoolsâ where irresponsible parents send kids to learn evolution and other godless things. These folks will tell you they highly value education â Christian education at Christian schools. Every dollar sent to government schools promotes secular humanism. The âteachersâ are not valiant educators, theyâre tools of liberals attacking the Real America. For many solution is to switch to vouchers and eliminate government schools."
4809,NewsDesk,"My daughter taught in an inner-city school in a large urban district for 15 years. She has three master's degrees and six certifications. She had no white children in her middle school. The students adored her. I went to her classroom several times. There WERE NO BOOKS IN HER LIBRARY. I contacted a foundation run by one of the Major League Baseball players at the time, and the people running the foundation thought I was kidding when I told them the library had no books until they visited the school, opened the door and saw the bare shelves. The foundation supplied the library with books. Why SHOULD we have to go to foundations and ask for something as basic as books? Now I read to kids in an inner city elementary school via a program that gathers donated books and gives them to children to bring home. When I give a child a book to take home, one might think I had just given him or her a pot of gold. The teacher with whom I work is a genius, dedicated to her students in a way that would inspire anyone who would observe her. She's creative, loving, yet has rules in her classroom. The kids look up to her. <br/><br/>My daughter's not teaching right now. She's home with two small children. But she's still repaying a plethora of student loans. She THOUGHT she was eligible for loan forgiveness after having taught in the inner city for so long, but someone at the loan agency lost a piece of paperwork she needed, so they rejected her application. Maybe she'll go back, maybe not. "

4813,NewsDesk,"You only have to be aware of the huge number of Americans who are science-ignorant, gullible, credulous of fake news, unable to have rational thoughts to recognize that we are a country that skimps on education.

Teachers deserve 95K a year if it fits how well the kids are taken care of but if you have classrooms crumbling and duck taped books -- teachers prob shouldn't be getting 95k a year.<br/><br/>IT is all BUDGET ISSUES.  And how the board delivers the funds.<br/><br/>Then the same school complains its because of the kids not speaking English.  <br/><br/>so while the kids have NOTHING..the SUPERINTENDENT gets PAID GAS to travel a 15 mile radius all school year lol....  All the higher ups and education board squander all the MONEY AWAY from the kids and schools.  seriously 250K a year?  These people are not doctors.  And Superintendents and board member's didn't do this 40 years ago.   <br/><br/>  Main problems with schools is the money is not spent on kids.    "
4816,NewsDesk,School administrators should be paid as much as their teachers. Period.
4817,NewsDesk,"I'm glad an article like this is hitting the masses. It is something that needs more attention. I am the husband of a Teacher who has been in the field for  10 years now and it's a shame what has happened to the education system in just a short amount of time.  No funds for school supplies and decent buildings that are up to code to be taught in are just a tip of the Iceberg.  What lies beneath in most places involves that of a decaying system that ensures nothing but failure for the future of our country. I hope this is a step in the right direction for the future in education with children and young adults across this Country. I would go on into greater detail, but it's just too much to talk about in a comment section on a post for an article on The New York Times site."
4818,NewsDesk,"if Americans really cared about education it would have never got this bad, and if Republicans get their way it will get even worse as they continue to cut funding.

4819,NewsDesk,"Based on the mentality of about 40% of the population these days, I'd guess the textbooks were 250 years old."
4820,NewsDesk,"I am inspired that the teachers are marching. I have talked to several retired teachers who said they also had done many of same things that these dedicated professionals do.<br/><br/>I went to a one room country school and I know physical conditions weren't great. This was after the Great Depression and Dust Bowl and during WW II. The heat was from a single stove and AC was six open windows.  But I did have some new books and plenty of paper for art projects. (I don't think the teachers purchased any of the supplies.) It was where I found out I could draw and paint and established my love for books and writing. Some of my teachers were really good, a few not so. They had a double whammy of having to teach all grades one thru eight. I learned a lot by observing the older students reciting their lessons. It was a wonderful experience and I went on to establish a great career. <br/><br/>We live in a wealthy country with many opportunities. Our technological strides have been phenomenal. I don't think there are any excuses now that our Federal and State Governments in this country can't come through for our children. Anyone who isn't willing to pay taxes to support our schools needs to be deported, since they're not contributing to the success of our country and are a detriment to our future. I believe they are called ""takers"". "
4821,NewsDesk,"This is not new. In 1975, when I was in an upstate NY High School, my social studies textbook was copyrighted 1959. I had to petition my guidance counselor to overrule a failing grade in a ""fill-in-the-map"" test because I  filled in the names of the south-east Asia countries that actually existed at the time of the test. Forgive me for knowing better! Later, a Brazilian friend of mine in college said ""What amazes me most about Americans is their  complete and utter inability to view any issue from a frame of reference other than - ""What it means to the U.S.A.""  Such is the complete and utter failure of the U.S. education system.  Trump's ""America First"" mindset props up the notion that is an acceptable world view, and it is one that may doom the U.S. of A in every way shape and form.          "
4822,NewsDesk,"As a fellow teacher, I long ago learned that politicians care little for education, just for corporate dollars to fund their campaigns. We are a wealthy country, so wealthy that  our lovely congress and president recently gave the largest tax cut in recent history to the wealthy, not to the working classes. How about abandon that tax cut and put some money in education? When I think about how much my teachers created a world at large for me to explore and learn about and see what education has turned into these past twenty years, it makes me realize that changes, big changes are needed in this country. We need a social revolution where education matters again. But, if people don't vote to make changes, nothing will happen, and that means vote these people out of Washington and the states legislatures who continually cut the financial throat of education."
4823,NewsDesk,How can the U.S. remain a world leader when its citizens and workers have such a training/education deficit compared to other wealthy economies?
4824,NewsDesk,"All I can say is VOTE. Pay attention to the priorities of candidates for local, state, and federal offices. <br/><br/>If candidates support siphoning money away from the public education system to charter and private schools then they are undermining the public system.<br/><br/>Also vote out of office those on public school boards who collude to overcompensate executive administrators at the expense of your district's students and teachers."
4825,NewsDesk,"I'm angry, but I'm more angry at the state government than anyone else.  The public education system here in Ca.  is a discrace.  The state lotto was supposed to go to school funding.  Funding is cut.  Voter tax initiatives are supposed to go to school funding, Funding is cut.  The funding generated and designated to go to the schools here in this state are routinely misappropriated and diverted to other uses."
4826,NewsDesk,"While they show you dilapidated buildings and obsolete textbooks, have you checked out the football stadiums at some of these schools? We have astro turfed fields with state of the art everything that would be the envy of many a bygone Roman Emperor. When asked about the cost of those facilities we always hear they are paid for by the ""Booster Clubs"" or ticket sales. No, they are paid for by the communities where they are located and shortchanging the educational portion of school attendance. We should emphasize nurturing brains not destroying them. What are your priorities America?   "
4827,NewsDesk,"I don't even need to read this.  It's a disgrace, and infuriating.  The US has plenty of funds when it comes to its 'priorities', but clearly education is not one of those priorities.<br/><br/>I am sickened each time I hear of 'donations' being asked for, for school supplies for a local teacher, or bookbags for poor students, etc.  I am sickened each time I hear of students and/or their parents canvassing the neighborhood, the parents' office colleagues, to buy 'stuff' the kids/school are selling, all to raise money.  I am sickened to hear of 'bake sales', again, to help our schools get by with everyday needs.<br/><br/>In fact, I'd like to see people STOP making such donations to schools, for so long as we taxpayers pick up the slack, where our own government will not, well then.... they are just going to sit back and think 'well, the people will make up the difference' or 'well, the people don't seem mad enough...see them all running around baking their muffins, and having drives to collect unused backpacks for local students?'<br/><br/>Just like the current gun control issue, it's time for more anger from the general populace.  For far too long, we have been complacent, as one area after another, has fallen by our own government's wayside.  Where is the outrage?"
4828,NewsDesk,Wow. I bought five laptops during a Christmas sale the year before last to donate to a school in Nicaragua- they only had five computers and were sharing like four kids per computer. I had no idea that American schools were as bad off as the ones in Nicaragua. It honestly never occurred to me. It definitely didn't occur to me that some teachers literally build their own desks. This is awful.
4829,NewsDesk,"This is the outcome of Republican indoctrination that taxes are a bad thing.  I thought the problem was mostly in Utah,  where I  live, which went from excellent schools to very low- rated ones.  Is ir a reflection of the desire of the industrialists, who seem intent on running the world, to create a serf-like mass of people to do their bidding? "
4830,NewsDesk,"When I was in elementary/middle school (2000-2008ish) we used textbooks from the 1990s and early 2000s all the time. They weren't as bad as the ones in the article but they would have been thrown out by the city library for being too beat up. The worn covers falling apart, the pages covered in grafitti, the outdated info- it's all familiar. As far as I can recall we also never learned about recent stuff  like the Iran-Contra affair or Vietnam or Iraq either. I went to elementary and middle school in a very rich school district but sometimes there weren't enough seats in the classrooms for the kids and the textbooks were absolutely shredded and outdated too. "
4831,NewsDesk,"I'm a school librarian in Chicago and I cannot begin to explain how I share the same issues as these teachers.  For one, I'm ""lucky"" to have a job.  We have 150 librarians serving 500+ schools -- most schools lack a librarian and therefore have no library.  Once a librarian is cut, the library is just a room.  It's typically closed and those books are never used again.  <br/><br/>I've received $0 - $1,000 in a budget the past five years.  $1k is enough to buy 80 books, maybe.  The principal works diligently to insure school conditions are safe, so I'm thrilled to say we lack the pest issues other schools face.  However, I feel like it's my part-time job to find funding for books, furniture, supplies, and you name it.  I'm reimbursed $250 per year by CPS - and I usually spend all of it by October.  Running a school library is not cheap, especially if you want a well-run library program with new books that pique students' interest.  I spend my nights on Donorschoose and grant websites writing grants for the library.  Speaking of which - you're welcome to donate to my library if you are so able.  Donorschoose: Ms. Westerberg in Chicago.  Gahhh, it's exhausting to beg strangers to purchase what this city, state, and country should provide.  More books, less missiles.  <br/><br/>Libraries are essential.  I just wish more administrators realized this."
4832,NewsDesk,Our president wants to spend 20 billion dollars on a wall that is of questionable value. That same 20 billion dollars works out to $200/student because  we have 50 million students in public and primary schools. Seems like we would be far better off as a nation spending that money on students vs a wall.
4833,NewsDesk,"State Legislatures ruin the country. DC does a fine job too but look local and you can see how they can easily remove funding. Republican led legislatures have been bleeding education for 20+ years. It's no wonder the US is statistically failing in Math, Science and Reading against other first world countries. "
4834,NewsDesk,"The condition of our schools is just like most everything else in this country including our crumbling infrastructure, the condition of our National parks, and on and on. Our ""leaders"" ESPECIALLY NOW, are completely incompetent and morally corrupt. Our President is no longer at all, and cares about nothing but his narcissistic image and hiding all his corruption. This is leadership? We are in a desperate situation people, and most are just too dumb to see it."

4836,NewsDesk,"I am not the only person who believes that the gutting of our Public Schools is a deliberate long-term program by power-hungry people who simply don't want the population at large to be able to analyze what's happening to them.

4837,NewsDesk,"Meanwhile, money is siphoned from underfunded public schools to support unregulated charter schools."
4838,NewsDesk,"It is getting harder and harder to get into top 25 US Universities because more and more qualified students apply, SAT and ACT become harder and harder as many more students make perfect scores on them so something is going right in the US education.

4839,NewsDesk,"I wish teachers and other civil service people would understand that the entire middle class has been beaten down.   At least they do not have H-1b holders taking their jobs.   The unions have never stuck up for the private sector middle class, and as Detroit should have taught them, you cannot have a strong public sector middle class without a strong private sector middle class.   Instead, the unions demand more and more immigration, and wonder why the middle class is going, going ....."
4840,NewsDesk,"Words cannot express the gratitude I feel towards educators standing up to our government and saying enough is enough. I too am a 14 year veteran in the public school system and I make 36,800.00 annually  (in a place where a pound of grapes cost 10.00)and often find myself spending my money to subsidize basic items in the classroom. Teachers are left to purchase paper, ask parents and friends to make copies, raise money to buy ink, used 10 to 15 year old text books, share desks with other teachers, mop flooded classrooms,  and purchase water (because the water fountains are rusted out and haven't worked in years) just to name a few. I love my job and it is shameful that this is where we are with education in America. "
4841,NewsDesk,"There can be no equal opportunity for all if there is not equal education for all.<br/><br/>Education has never been a preoccupation of the government of the US. From the beginning, the rich, land-owning class, farmers, and later, the middle classes, were loath to pay higher taxes to educate the general population, and especially the poor. The Department of Education, a cabinet-level department only since 1979, has no direct jurisdictional control. <br/><br/>Education in America is financed largely through local property taxes. This guarantees the richest districts get the best schools and the poorest districts the worst. Promises from congress to fix the educational system are empty and meaningless. The only way change in the education system can be effected is to change the way public schools are funded. Which means turning many powers of education over to the Federal government.<br/><br/>Conservatives, and statesâ rights advocates demonize federal involvement in education. This is just a feint to allow state and local legislators to continue their control over education and  capriciously and disproportionately reduce funding for schools in the poorest districts. <br/><br/>In order to assure a just distribution of equal opportunity in education, and teacher pay, congress needs to enact a national education act just as it did when it passed the Voting Rights Act to help assure that all Americans could vote."
4842,NewsDesk,I was actually surprised at how good some of the salaries are for teaching.  
4843,NewsDesk,I wonder if Betsy DeVoss had not been appointed if this would have come out and bern printed in The Times<br/><br/>Nothing like having a lightning rod  political opponent to focus attention on a long term problem.

4845,NewsDesk,"What an absolute disgrace!  That the supposedly ""richest nation on Earth"" invests so poorly in the education of our children says a lot about where our priorities are, and aren't.<br/><br/>What are the politicians and public officials such as Betsy DeVos doing?  Either nothing, or worse than nothing.  The Republican zeal for ""cutting budgets"" and slashing public spending has got to stop.  It has done untold damage to generations of children.

The blue states they are doing well, are getting ahead, are generating most of the money in America.  That is because, for the most part, they invest in education. <br/><br/>Interesting fact: during the Reconstruction, more schools were built in the South than had been in the previous 100 years.  And schools stopped being built as soon as Reconstruction ended. "

4851,NewsDesk,"I'm a teacher and have been for the past 5 years. I've only taught in title I high poverty schools and worked with diverse groups of students. I love teaching and honestly believe America's commitment to public education system is our country's greatest achievement. <br/><br/>However, I think we've abandoned that commitment to public education for all - beginning with Brown v. Board in 1954 and then accelerating that abandonment during Reagan's presidency. <br/><br/>We're now at the point where it feels like public education has to justify its existence in order to receive funding and succeed. Many ignore systemic problems like high poverty schools and low teacher pay and offer band-aid solutions like Donors Choose or insulting pay raises. <br/><br/>So many of these comments offer a fatalism about our education system, but I honestly believe these problems are not endemic to public education. Committing ourselves to actually addressing our public education system - emphasizing equity, multiculturalism and bridging the opportunity gap - would lead to positive outcomes for so many of our students. "
4852,NewsDesk,"It seems there is a lot of echo here, but if we choose to ignore that pensions are eating up local budgets, there is too much administration, and that there is much theft in the system, more money will accomplish nothing."
4853,NewsDesk,"For many, many, many years anytime an article or discussion was had regarding school supplies, school facilities, new technology, having schools have the proper staff and resources and other related matters I have always heard and read, stated in the loudest and most forceful terms, that the children come first and the children are our future. It turns out that these were all lies."
4854,NewsDesk,"Ah ha! This is how Trump got elected. A poorly educated populous results in a weak democracy, easily threaten by weak leadership."
4855,NewsDesk,"In New Jersey, public schools are mostly funded by outrageous property taxes.  The very wealthy towns pay the highest taxes  and usually have the best schools.  The poor towns have the least amount of money and support poorer preforming districts.  The 21 counties in NJ are home to 590 districts in the state and each district fights for its own dollars. Itâs separate but equall in the 21st century.  To me itâs just another form on institutional racism where wealth and power determine outcomes of children.  Why share when I can have all the toys?"
4856,NewsDesk,"I never even sniffed 100K as a professional in both accounting and engineering, getting that much for being a public teacher is obscene.  Not to mention I bet they get a pension which I never got either."
4857,NewsDesk,"What is wrong with us? Some people from the areas with horribly underfunded districts voted for a president who would spend billions on a vanity wall.  But the problem exists all over the country, except in districts where there is sufficient local income to support local school property taxes. Or where we have seen, well to do residents can afford to provide additional support.<br/><br/>We have gone up and down and p agains in terms of the national eonomy. ehat distresses me is that when we are constantly hearing that corporations and top earners have more wealth than ever know before -  crucial public services like schools - are dying from underfunding. We are allowing the country to deteriorate, bridge by bridge, school by school, child by child."

4859,NewsDesk,"Shame on all of us US for letting this happen. <br/><br/>Businesses complain they have to bring in foreign workers because US workers don't have the ""right"" skills. Why? Because we as a society don't care enough to educate ALL our children. We gut education and then complain about not having the ""right skills?""  <br/><br/>There are too many untapped brilliant minds among the majority who can't afford to send their children to Private schools. <br/><br/>Looking at what we are giving our teachers -- the men &amp; women we ask to prepare our children for the future and teach them basic skills -- makes me sick to my stomach. <br/><br/>This is what ""privatization"" has done. It's wrong. <br/><br/>For every penny of funds siphoned off by private schools, 20 children (likely more) do without because ""there's no money for that"" -- it was all taken by the private sector for their profit. There's no public benefit. It's all about greed.  <br/><br/>For every $1 dollar given to any private school on any voucher program, $20 should be given to the public school that is being sapped of funds by that very same voucher program. And the parents who are so well off they can afford private school should be required to pay additional taxes to support their Community public school. <br/><br/>Used to be entire communities wanted all the children get to know each other and be educated -- the one-room schoolhouse. Now, apparently, a good education is only for the rich and advantaged. <br/><br/>That is wrong. Every child should have a chance. Each and every one. "
4860,NewsDesk,Talk is cheap. We say we care about our kids but I guess not. These teacher comments also explain why very few of the best and brightest become teachers. Richest country in the world. Tax cuts in the billions. Under resourced schools and crumbling infrastructure. A recipe for failure. And yet the same set of pathetic leaders get reelected by an electorate that is endlessly jacked up over social issues.
4861,NewsDesk,"The school in Providence, RI caught my eye. I used to live there and I vividly remember the city of Providence begging Brown University to pay taxes.<br/><br/>They refused year after year.

4862,NewsDesk,"Our education system has guaranteed a continuing supply of service level workers for fast food chains, and little else.<br/><br/>If there is a ""deep state"" at work, it must be our Senators and Representatives at both the State and Federal level working to destroy public schools in America - leaving only those who can afford the Betsy DeVoss plan to prosper.  What for the rest?  The Ghost of Education Present (with apologies to Dickens)  is here to haunt us for certain."
4863,NewsDesk,I once asked the school secretaries where I could find the supply room. They looked at me as though I had two heads.<br/><br/>I later learned it was located in my pants --my wallet!

Neighborhoods deserve better.  Open spaces, contact with nature, healthy food, healthy relationships, arts, music, language....How can anyone thrive?

Where is the partnership between communities and business to foster better facilities and supplies for schools?  Why is no one addressing that issue and making it public how little is given back to American communities especially our educational infrastructure?<br/>There is no shortage of money for education in America. There is a great mis-direction of that money to other uses or to line the pockets of too many who don't need it.<br/>We need to raise taxes on corporate giants especially at the local level to fund our schools.  I bet everyone of the communities starved for funds has a Wal Mart, or other big box retailer or large industrial company that pays nothing to support schools and education.  Let them give back. Let's demand it.  No more free ride at the expense of our children and their future.  "
4878,NewsDesk,"Iâm not a conspiracy theory type person, but when it comes to education in this country Iâm starting to believe something is afoot.

4880,NewsDesk,"For decades the Republican party has run on tax cuts, tax cuts, tax cuts and government is the problem, the problem, the problem.   The media has, to a great extent, been complicit -- ie, Paul Ryan is a serious policy wonk (not) and Republicans are the fiscally conservative ones (not).   So, after decades of this propaganda, too many of the voters see no connection between taxes and services, taxes and schools, taxes and infrastructure.  Too many think paying taxes is only for fools.    What we all end up with are these schools and watching the US become more and more a third world country."
4881,NewsDesk,These teachers are true heroes.

It's all ""every man (sic) for himself.""  Schools should be funded at the same level across localities and not depend on local taxes.  The education of our children is essential for a democracy to function.  WAKE UP AMERICA!"
4884,NewsDesk,These stories r unbelievable!  And many of these schools r located in states where I wouldnât expect such devastation. Why r we paying huge amounts of school taxes if this is the state of the average classroom. Iâd rather give my tax dollars to the Teachers to use for the students. Very sad situation!
4885,NewsDesk,"I have worried for many years that the USA could, if we continue to neglect schools and infrastructure, turn into a third world country. I taught English in Senegal from 1970-1973 and with one exception, all the 'classrooms' I taught in were in abandoned buildings. The English textbooks supplied by the school were ancient and published in England for use in France. The first chapter was about PIcadilly Circus.<br/>Reading this article and looking at the photos is discouraging. If we are too stupid to invest in our children, we will have brought a dark future down on our own heads."
4886,NewsDesk,"Truly, we need to ask ourselves what went wrong in America? What happened to so-called ""American values""? Half of the country is voting for politicians who have nothing but contempt for the common good, and many Republicans are actively working to destroy public education. Can anything be more shameful than expecting teachers to pay, out of their meager salaries, for the things our government refuses to provide for our children? It's sickening. The  disastrous underfunding of public schools is intentional and must be stopped. Think about the pictures in this article, and then think about a 1.5 trillion dollar tax cut, going mostly to corporations and the rich, and tacked on to the deficit for the rest of us to repay. Our children are being set up for a future as debt peons and virtual slaves. The rest of us must join teachers in the battle to save our schools. Otherwise, we must stop kidding ourselves about what we value.  "
4887,NewsDesk,"This is all happening on purpose! The GOP wants to keep people poor, uneducated and angry, which helps them voting against their own interests. "
4888,NewsDesk,"This is what 50 years of attacks on big government bring you.  Reagan's war on taxes has drained all of the coffers.  There is no money for schools due to trickle down economics.  Stop the nonsense, fund the commonwealth with taxes on corporate profits."
4889,NewsDesk,"Most unfortunately, Republicans have convinced Americans that taxes are a bad thing.  The rest of the developed world knows that taxes pay for roads, bridges, health care and so importantly, education for all citizens.  Congress just gave a huge tax cut to corporations, like Apple, and wealthy people , like Best DeVos, who don't need it.  When will  we wake up and realize that we are making ourselves into a third world country by not demanding they pay their fair share and electing people who will support their constituents ?"
4890,NewsDesk,"State and local governments are to blame as are school teachers and administrators themselves for failing to organize and stand up for themselves and their students. Republican state legislatures across the nation have gutted education. They have fostered disrespect and total diminishment of the value of teachers and education.  Also, the federal government bears great responsibility for not publishing data on schools that desperately need funds. And finally great responsibility goes to parents who are disinterested and detached from their children's educational needs and the needs of schools.<br/>There is plenty of blame to go around. It is Republican administrations that have been most vicious in the gutting of public schools and the devaluation of teachers and the profession of education our children.<br/>Teachers must organize, march, protest and begin action to promote their own future and the future of our educational system.<br/>Citizens must vote out legislators who refuse to value and fund schools and pay teachers a livable wage.  Citizens are the key to change.<br/>What will it take to awaken everyone to the desperate needs of schools, teachers and students?  Why is education the first budget item to be cut?  Why don't we value education and educators?  We don't need to answer rhetorical questions but we do need to take action.<br/>Our failure to meet the economic needs of our educational system will surely mean an end to our democracy.  It is the most important investment."
4891,NewsDesk,"I have seen the horrible conditions in our schools and the amazing things our dedicated teachers do to create great classrooms.   They need more money now without question.  However I also donât see the same dilapidated buildings when I look at district and especially state-level administration offices.   We are also not putting the money we have into the hands of front-line teachers and are we still funding admin operating models that have grown bloated while our teachers are starved.  Let them make do with less and give every cent to our teachers - and more (obviously, revenue increases also have to be part of the story).   I worry that the admin beast will eat the funding, though, if itâs not tamed.  "
4892,NewsDesk,I will bet that the football and basketball teams at many of these schools pictured have enough uniforms and equipment for their players.<br/><br/>It's all about priorities.
4893,NewsDesk,I just want to throw up.  What does the future of country look like with this foundation.  Sooner or later the poor and poorly educated will rise up.  the greatest trick the republicans did was to convince  the poor they were on their side.
4894,NewsDesk,"We have had no budget cuts here, but we have had incompetent management.  They kept schools open long after they were not required, wasted a lot of money on consultants, and basically wrecked our public schools.

4895,NewsDesk,"Iâm now semi retired as a middle school science teacher (Iâm conducting outdoor ed field trips), so I am on board with many of the comments.  But despite the anger, and seeming logic, many of the comments directed towards the federal government, like how much it spends on defense (which actually isnât half the budget), are misdirected.  The feds are not going to take over any major funding of public education or create a national education system  - itâs in control of the states and is politically going to stay there.<br/><br/>We need increased state level taxes to support education in many states, maybe some that are constitutionally earmarked strictly for education; and a lot of streamlining of administration in many other states - too many local little non consolidated districts.  And yes, the feds could help - not as much with the teacher expense deduction as with taking the lid off a deduction for state taxes dedicated specifically to education.  If people knew they would get an absolute deduction or credit of some kind for education taxes, they might accept higher state income or property taxes.<br/><br/>But the pressure has to start on local and state government, and your local rep in Congress.  Stop venting at Trump or âthe Republicansâ - put the heat on local politicians whatever party."
4896,NewsDesk,"When education takes a backseat to sports. When education takes a backseat to societyâs responsibility for the next generation, that society is in trouble.

In Polson the special ed kids were housed in the garage - the classroom wreaked of solvent and gasoline and kids were exposed all day long.  In St. Ignatius there were wasps and hornets in the ceilings.  In Charlo the toilets were from 1937 and clogged regularly. Arlee had ecoli in the water. But Potomac stands out, kids in two classrooms in a basement in an area known for radon - they never tested it.  30 year old textbooks were common, mold and leaking roofs abounded.  The pay was unreal, at 25 years, when I couldn't take it anymore, I made 61,000 a year, with 6 years of graduate school.  Montana hates their public school system.   "
4898,NewsDesk,And yet the wealthy have billions beyond compare.  Bank Of America posted record profits today.  The massive Trump tax break that puts the US into a $Trillion dollar deficit was mostly spent by corporations buying back stock to enrich shareholders over salaries to the working.

4904,NewsDesk,"I am a former consultant for the NYC public schools, and believe me, they are crumbling just like the other schools in this country. I wish I could post all the photos I've taken! Many schools have lead in the water, kids are learning in trailers and temporary buildings, and the bathrooms are absolutely horrible. I used to carry toilet paper and soap with me, but some schools didn't even have a working sink in the bathroom. I'm back to teaching at a private school now, and am always shocked by the availability of hot tea and soap in the bathrooms. The kids of America deserve better. "
4905,NewsDesk,"It would also be helpful to know what the expected pension of each of these teachers is, and their life expectancy. Teacher salary is an inadequate measure of income for people in that profession. It is misleading. That pension money is public money that could be spent on material. "

4908,NewsDesk,This article points out the importance of spending more money on administration.

After all, we have an 18 trillion dollar a year economy.<br/><br/>But we can't give repeated tax cuts to big corporations, wage wars all over the world and pay for our children's future. This report tells us what our elected officials really think about the value of education."

4918,NewsDesk,Thanks to all the teachers for sharing their personal information for this important article. I found the pay differential between the women and men with similar years of experience as disturbing as the lack of funding for classrooms.

Here in NY, teachers are paid REALLY well have have benefits that include a  healthy retirement plan and health care.

4920,NewsDesk,"One thing that hasn't been discussed is the lack of student field trips.  School used to be the place where students went to Natural History Museum for the first time, or a play, or even the zoo.  Even though I teach in a suburban school district, all field trips were cancelled fifteen years ago even if students could pay for it.  Now, when I ask my HS Biology students how many have been to a museum to see the dinosaur display, only 1 student raised their hands.  Most had never even been to the zoo.  None of them had ever been on a hike through the woods.  Schools used to do so much more in introducing kids to wonders of the world around them.  "
4921,NewsDesk,"This decay of vital public services is the result of decades of Republican political control in poorer, red states.  The wealthy get to keep their money. <br/><br/>The remainder get to buy all the guns they want and the satisfaction of knowing only the wealthy can buy abortions. Letâs hope they notice in November that they actually are getting a pretty lousy deal."
4922,NewsDesk,"This is just horrifying. Only two of the teachers are being adequately compensated based on their degrees, and nearly all of them are dealing with grossly substandard teaching conditions. Despite this, teachers are painted as being lazy and overpaid. As the child of a teacher, I know that's far from the truth, but at least the compensation in Massachusetts is adequate. <br/><br/>These teachers who are making poverty level wages are a stain on this country. It's a wonder they keep showing up to work at all. I hope they all go out on strike and demand the compensation and teaching conditions they deserve."
4923,NewsDesk,Talent development is critical to any advanced capitalistic free market. <br/><br/>Want to have a good economy?  Then you must invest in talent development.<br/><br/>What is crowding out educational funding? Healthcare? Pensions? Imbalanced international trade?  Fix it.
4924,NewsDesk,"So where to begin?  Whenever a taxing authority grants tax breaks to lure a business, that shortfall has to be made up somewhere. A school district that builds sporting facilities that most small colleges would love to have. Northside Independent School District has campuses that most junior colleges would like. Meanwhile in one year while my tax rate is fixed, the value of my home went up by $13K, in effect raising my taxes while the politicians claim they didn't raise taxes.   My school district is getting ready to float a bond issue just short of $1,000,000,000,000.  They float these bonds on a regular basis. My property taxes account for almost 20% of my fixed income.  Income and sales tax push my taxes north of 35%.  I will vote against the bond issue.  In the haste to cut taxes to gain political seats, we are now reaping the consequences. "
4925,NewsDesk,School funding must be divorced from property taxes and put in State and federal budgets. After looking at recent schools and facilities built in rich neighborhoods  students from the poorer sections of town should protest the to the school board and demand the same.
4926,NewsDesk,"Itâs always been puzzling to me that âconservativesâ tax cuts starve school budgets.  Ironically, itâs the students who emerge that are the next generation of taxpayers â education is not so much an expense as it is an investment.  <br/><br/>My father-in-law, from a blue collar background, served in the armed forces and then went on to college and law school, all financed in part by the GI bill.  He settled in Westchester, became a judge, and paid back in taxes many times over what he received.<br/><br/>So much of what we see in current Republican policies are similarly short-sighted: failing to rebuild our crumbling infrastructure, address income inequality or guarantee adequate health care for all Americans.  As with education, expenditures in these crucial areas are more accurately thought of as investments in keeping America great and represent the truly conservative outlook the GOP should be promoting."
4927,NewsDesk,"""Surely more tax cuts will solve these problems"", said legislators over the last 30 years (and many still)."
4928,NewsDesk,"This is the reality of public schools in America. It is a topic under discussed and ignored by the representatives on Capitol Hill. Public school education is no longer a priority. The children that can not afford or choose not to go to private school are left behind. I would know. Iâm an eight grader at a public school in St. Louis. I have always assumed most schools are broken down with twenty year old textbooks. My instructors make so little money, some work three jobs to take care of their families. Itâs a mess and Iâm not sure how much more we can take before we explode. "
4929,NewsDesk,"None of this surprises me. I was in Massachusetts public school from '96-'07, and even back then, in one of the best public schools systems in the state, I saw textbooks like this. We had history books that thought the Vietnam War was still going on, science textbooks that made no mention of computers, and our math ""books"" were disposable packets that had long outlived their intended life spans. When I transferred to an alternative school, the quality of materials, educators, and facilities went way up - but so did the costs. I heard back then this alternative school cost my public school district nearly as much as a public university.<br/><br/>America has been divesting from their public education for decades, and now we're seeing the affect this has on our democracy. An electorate must be well educated if it is to be effective. News sources can only do so much if the reader never was given the tools to identify which ones are credible, never mind form and articulate an opinion on the stories of the day. <br/><br/>Education will always be expensive, but if we wish to continue to lead the world as a democracy and technological super power, we must invest. Education should be the first to receive its budgets, and the last to see cuts. Our teachers need to be paid a living wage, and we need to hire more of them to get better student:teacher ratios. Just order a few less F-35s, and we should be able to pick up the tab without much issue."
4930,NewsDesk,The current disregard for funding education also extends into the Public University systems. Our legislators seem to feel that an UNeducated electorate is best for our country. <br/><br/>I am tired of what is probably our most important societal investment being treated as an expense. 
4931,NewsDesk,"...and yet there is money to arm teachers? Why not arm teachers with words, images, ideas, a respectable salary, and an inspiring learning environment."
4932,NewsDesk,"It is hard to believe that these stories are happening in America. What are these government officials thinking about? These students are our countryâs future generation. As a tax payer, I feel that we are obligated to see that the future of our country is protected. What are we leaving our children?"
4933,NewsDesk,"I have been a teacher in the Boston Public Schools for over a decade. In such a wealthy city, youâd think our students would easily have access to science and social studies, field trips, counselors, and reading specialists. Our students are in segregated schools - I teach in a high poverty school with 99% children of color. I feel fortunate to have received so many donations from DonorsChoose over the years. I am always seeking opportunities to highlight our students and their strengths and needs -through writing, presenting, networking. But why should it be so hard to get folks to invest in our children? Every day is an advocacy battle, and teachers are the strongest warriors in voicing the reality of American education. "
4934,NewsDesk,"Thank you for sharing these teachers' experiences as they illustrate the hypocrisy of our legislators. <br/><br/>Great lip-service is given the need for quality preschool and K-16 education to prepare our kids for their rapidly evolving world. But when it comes to prioritizing funding education bills and budget items are considered last. For many states the ideology of ""no new taxes"" dictates that there can be ""no new investment"" in education even though numerous legitimate studies tell us that quality education is THE essential element to success in life.<br/><br/>We as a nation need to re-evaluate our priorities."
4935,NewsDesk,"This is what Republican tax cuts have done to our schools, and what they have done to our infrastructure in general.  Strong evidence that ""trickle down"" does not work, and a shameful example of what ""making America great again"" really means.  Thank you to the dedicated teachers who are still teaching and who truly value education.  We hope that help will be on the way after the November elections."
4936,NewsDesk,"As a room parent and volunteer at my sons' elementary school, I get a front row seat about the public schools. Most of the critics of public schools haven't stepped foot in one in decades. <br/><br/>We are fortunate that Stamford has very strong schools, and that former schools superintendent Joshua Starr standardized the curriculum before Common Core kicked in. That said, it's a disgrace that education is at the bottom of barrel in the U.S. The schools are crumbling. In one of the schools, the doors to the classroom were close to falling off. PTOs are raising money to buy smart boards. Parents have to provide soap. This is ridiculous."
4937,NewsDesk,"Having worked abroad for many years, I noticed several things, in poorer countries, only ""wealthy"" kids get to go to school so parents beg and scrape to get the money for tuition and uniforms so their kids can have a shot at being ""wealthy"". The kids see what the family is doing for them and they work hard so as to not show disrespect. <br/><br/>In the US, schools in poor areas (urban and rural) are not seen as pathways to ""wealth"" instead are seen as social clubs or babysitters. Then where are the jobs? In other countries bright students can go to college in a foreign country and then get good jobs in that country. What can a poor kid from Chicago do? They cannot even afford to go to a community college let alone afford the ""bond"" needed to attend a ""free"" foreign college. <br/><br/>So yes, students need a desire to learn and do well, but they also need realistic end goals. "

4942,NewsDesk,"The education isn't limited to the private schools.  As a matter of fact, public schools, with all the shortfalls in their funding, statistically do a better job of educating students than do privates.<br/><br/>Of course, private school parents do a better job of helping their kids do well in life, for the simple reason that they're affluent enough to pay private school tuition, but public schools really are spinning gold out of straw.<br/><br/>We should pay public school teachers to reflect that."
4943,NewsDesk,"No.  Probably you should send your kids to a public school and support a system that offers a better education than homeschooling, and offers it to all kids, not just the ones of parents who can opt out and fend for themselves."

4947,NewsDesk,"This has been going on at least since the early 1980âs. People stopped thinking about the âcommon goodâ and the âsocial contractâ where the wealthy felt obliged to help those who were less fortunate. Reagan ushered in this way of thinking,  and the novel notion that government was the enemy and less of it was better for America. Americans ran with it and started voting for all these crazy propositions that would lower property taxes and other state taxes. Local services, infrastructure, and the quality of education all declined. You get what you pay for. <br/><br/>Bring back communitarianism! "
4948,NewsDesk,"You can blame the Boomer Republicans in the national and state legislatures, but most Boomers are just average Joes whose first job opportunity was fighting in Vietnam or fighting to avoid it.

4957,NewsDesk,"Sorry, Linda, but all of this pre-dates Trump. <br/><br/>Or was he the one who cut taxes on the rich in the 80s, 90s, and 00s and then balanced those cuts on the backs of Americaâs kids? <br/><br/>Put the blame squarely where it belongs: Reagan-Clinton-Bush-Obama Era Neoliberalism."

The list goes on.<br/><br/>Most bldgs are 75 to 100 years old but there isn't any fund to maintain it properly. As long as you have buildings in this condition, you can't ask teacher to teach year round. Especially in sweltering heat with no A/C. We've had bldgs reach 105 degrees in early June. The water fountains don't work or it ""tastes funny"" as the kids say.  They won't even drink it. We all just melt and pray for a breeze.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, non teachers keep beating the drum about ""independent thinkers"" and ""using technology"". How independent can you be when your textbooks are older than your students and the building can't handle the power load to have enough computers for every child. Even with laptops, the wifi doesn't work well. And we now have to do state testing, online.<br/><br/>And if the kids tank the test? It's all our fault. Even for me, the art teacher. "

I'd say teaching abroad can be much simpler that dealing with such complexities that most teachers deal with every year in the US. Also, this really isn't a young person's game as you suggest.

4979,Upshot,"As is almost say at the beginning of this article, other developed countries achieve better overall health outcomes at a fraction of the financial cost and a fraction of the emotional trauma that we do here.

4981,Upshot,"I like this idea as it makes us confront what is important in giving health care.<br/>Since tax increases of any type seem to be out of the question, the issue, in part, will be whether or not the reduced revenue to hospitals from budgeting equals or exceeds the amount that the hospitals would have given away as charitable care.<br/>The article also does not answer the most difficult question:  What if, come the end of the year, the hospital runs out of money, whether due to poor planning or unanticipated higher usage?  Does the hospital shut down?  Does the hospital go through temporary layoffs or keep dangerously low staffing?  Or does it go the V.A. route of severely rationing the number of patients seen at a hospital over a given period of time?  "

4983,Upshot,"I have been on Medicare with a supplemental of Anthem Blue Cross for over a decade. The hospitals and doctors charge whatever they want to charge, and Medicare pays what it wants to pay, which is way below the original charges. My supplemental pays what it wants to pay, which is never enough to cover the whole charge. Most of the time, these hospitals and doctors accept the payments and do not charge me for any more. Sometimes, there is a small payment I must make. I don't see the advantage of limiting what can be charged when the payments are only what these insurance accounts pay. "
4984,Upshot,"Capping total spending at the state level necessarily politicizes control over institutional margins and, indirectly,professional and managerial incomes.  The most politically powerful enterprises in most states are its state university academic health centers and regional multi-hospital systems, who will exert that power to ""capture"" the regulator, as has been the experience in Maryland.  Maryland has some of the highest per capita medical spending in the nation, despite thirty years of price controls. <br/><br/>Dr. Lazaron is on the right track. The way to achieve the savings he talks about is by standardizing and dramatically simplifying medical billing, and compelling all payers to use a common portal, data set and review standards for medical payment.  "
4985,Upshot,"American healthcare, which is really sickness care, costs a fortune, far more than any other country. The American system is not as effective a system in results delivered, either. Start figuring out why Americans get so sick,and how American life and ""healthcare differs from healthier countries with more effective healthcare. The reasons are obvious.  There are no fleets of insurance billing clerks in doctors offices and hospitals in Europe.      Patients are handed their records when they leave and are expected to bring them when they  come back. The governments are allowed to bargain with the drug companies over the cost of drugs--unlike the USA.  Malpractice awards are reasonable, not astronomical. Malpractice insurance fees do not weigh down the system.  Many procedures --most exams such as catscans, magnetic resonance exams, surgeries, etc., cost 1/4 to 1/10 of what the cost in the USA. The quality is not lower in Europe, the price is lower because the system is stripped of the waste which is in the American system. Doctors and nurses make far more money in the USA than in Europe. But the education is free for them in most european countries. They do not exit university with huge loans."
4986,Upshot,"The difference is that France and many other European countries pay their doctors, on average, about half of what U.S. doctors make.  Hospitals are also reimbursed or paid at much lower rates than in the U.S.<br/>How do you get doctors and hospitals to accept 50% pay cuts so that the health care system can provide the same panoply of services as provided in France at an affordable cost?"
4987,Upshot,"In other countries the poor, even the elderly, walk to get places.   Here we give rides.  Perhaps we ahould stop. "
4988,Upshot,The reason we have coders is because doctors donât want to charge by time like every other profession.  
4989,Upshot,"What would somebody in  Louisiana know about single payer in Canada?  I do, I live here!"
4990,Upshot,"I suggest before you get too wrapped in what doctors are paid in various countries, and that can vary significantly, you might want to check the doctor's costs in actually being a doctor.  On average, an American doctor pays FIVE to SIX times higher  premiums for malpractice insurance than a doctor in Canada.  Also, in a clinical environment, because of all the extra staff that has to be hired to deal with multiple insurance companies and the associated paperwork, cost are many times higher which, of course, the physicians have to pay out of the fees they receive.  Whether it be France, Canada, Britain or any other nation that has single payer healthcare,  unlike their American counterpart, upon graduation from medical school, they will not be stuck with a $250,000 student loan.  "
4991,Upshot,"Other countries institute price controls over everything, they don't just short change doctors and hospitals expecting consumers in the private insurance market to pick up the tab for the rest. And those countries will ration medical care, which means you can not get the latest cholesterol lowering drug. The doctor will prescribe you a diet with no red meat. They do not have patent protections so their prescription drugs are cheaper (see: Canada). And no other country has the obesity problem that the US has or consumes as many drugs (we consume 80% of the world's opiate supply and 40% of the world's cocaine supply). "
4992,Upshot,"Other countries either do complete price controls (that means controlling the cost of tuition for doctors, malpractice insurance, limiting lawsuits, etc) or ration care (you don't get the latest cholesterol drugs, you get a prescription for a red meat free diet). Our government short changes providers forcing the private market to pay the difference. They do not allow patent monopolies so their prescription drugs are cheaper (see: Canada). And no other country has an obesity problem like the US (60% of the population, 1 in 3 kids!) and no other country consumes drugs like the US (80% of the world's opiate supply and 40% of the world's cocaine supply).

4997,Learning,"My mom and I are remarkably close, but that doesn't mean that I am immune from what Lisa Damour described about wanting nothing more than to separate myself from my parents. My mom is the first person I turn to when I am upset and need someone to lean on and she is also the first person I go to when something amazing happens. She knows me better than anyone, but because she is a parent, a lot of pressure comes from her. Even when she tries not to put pressure on me (because I put enough of it on myself), I am still worried about how she will react if I don't succeed. I think it is almost an innate want to please your parents no matter how many times they tell you they just want you to be happy.<br/>Just because people are parent and child does not make them automatically compatible. Like, Michelle Kuo wrote, some parents will simply have different view points and ideals about how kids should be raised and the decisions they make as adults. However, I completely agree with the other part she said, about loving them no matter how confused and disapproving they might be about your choices because a parent's love is probably the one truly unconditional love in life and they will always be there, wishing the best for you.<br/>Again, even the best parent-child relationships will have ups and downs. Sometimes when somebody knows you so well, it can be frustrating and infuriating. I also know that no matter what, my mom will always be my best friend and the one person I can always rely on."
4998,Foreign,"In a 1994 article by John Carlin of Independent Co., Archbishop Desmond Tutu was quoted as saying, the new [South African] government had 'stopped the gravy train only long enough to get on'. <br/><br/>Like dross, the failings of humanity will almost always rise to the surface when a societyâs metal is tested with the heat of real transformation. I believe the time of dross is directly proportional to the depth of pure metal in the people of the country. To me, Russia is both a confusing and good example of just how long the time of dross can be. Twenty-four years and counting for South Africa is not good news. "

5001,Styles,"Great. The Saudis have successfully infantilized their women, such that fashion is the height of excitement. "
5002,Styles,"Having just visited Jeddah in February, I celebrate yet another step towards more freedoms for Saudi women. Yes the culture is very different from Western ones, but change is coming slowly in ways that are acceptable. While I was there many progressives urged caution in change happening too quickly as there are obviously some who disapprove. The women I spoke to were intelligent, well traveled and interested in preserving aspects of their culture while embracing new opportunities- going to university in other countries, access to coding and engineering in school, the ability to work. Those of us on the outside must respect the shift being done on their own terms. It is not for us to say how things should be done and how quickly. Good luck to all Saudi women in this next chapter!!"
5003,Styles,"It is crazy, it is insane .... When there be will be bikini show in Jeddah or Riyadh? When there will be alcoholic bar and dance club in Taif? What happened to religious police department or Saudi Mufti? Are Casino and gambling center will be opened in cities? It is like 1960's in America. Stay tuned."
5004,Styles,"""Those of us on the outside must respect the shift being done on their own terms.""<br/><br/>@ Euro Girl: While I understand the culturally diplomatic restraint you are proposing, lets just bear in mind that its not Saudi WOMEN who are ""shift[ing] on their own terms"".   Not at all.  Every single controlling step is being dictated by some male, and being done at a pace that the male feels  acceptable and least threatening to him.  <br/><br/>Being an apologist for eons and eons of anti-female oppression and for what is ultimately violence against females serves nobody and illuminates nothing.

5010,Metro,"Sad.  Obviously a man committed to good works, but it appears he became obsessive.  The drive to live is the strongest drive in the human body and mind.  Unfortunately, only the person who commits suicide truly knows why they did, but an underlying factor is almost always.  We all need to remember that nothing is ever as bad as it seems and noting in this world is worth taking your own life."
5011,Metro,"This is a depraved manner in which to make a statement. I can't help thinking about the guilt felt by tens of thousands of survivors of a family member or lover, or friend who killed themselves. It's difficult enough to convince survivors that no one can ""make"" a person commit suicide. In discussing the reasons he did this, people point to outside causes of despair that ""drove"" him to commit suicide.  Some people's reactions to this poor man's final act come close to describing it as heroic. We need to be careful and not attach any glamour or mournful respect to such a public act of horrific violence. He deserves neither condemnation nor honor for his suicide. I do truly sympathize for him and his desperate pain. But  what if even one other suffering soul came to the conclusion that repeating this behavior might bring  about a change for the good? I can't bear to think of living in a world that includes sacrificial suicide as an option. "
5012,Metro,Don't think too hard could be the US mantra these days.  Rest in peace.
5013,Metro,"So ironic that Trump is swimming in gazillions of documents and emails putting him at risk.  Remember him taunting Hillary about 30,000 emails accidentally erased before the company got the subpoena.   They found something like 20-30 classified items in the Hillary emails, most of those were declassified when she wrote but later was classified.  Remember Trump thrilled that all those DNC emails got released right before the convention, creating huge splits in the Bernie - Hillary voters.  Remember Trump loving Wikileaks in October when it grabbed headlines away from his pussy remarks, even though Podesta only talked about spaghetti recipes.  But it sure confused the public- boy, Hillary had surely done something wrong in all those emails people talked about ... even though DNC and Podesta had nothing to do with her security setup.  <br/><br/>Now here's Trump with documents and emails, facing risks of covering up Stormy Daniels and other information, making payoffs and bribes to keep things quiet ... paying off people to get sweetheart deals for hotels, colluding with Russians to get dirt on Hillary, making up dirt and coordinating dissemination, anything to get what you want.  The scale is so vastly different between Hillary's handful of security violations and the Trump payoffs ... Wikileaks, where are you now?  Would love to see it in October and put some nails into the coffin of the worst President the US has ever elected, a person elected by fraud, payoffs and scheming.  "

I was told by a NYC building engineer that pigeons are repelled by human scents, I put 2 Renuzit air fresheners on the terrace. It works great at repelling pigeons the only downside is that you have to remember to replace then every 2-3 weeks."
5024,RealEstate,"I sympathize with your loss.  I am a licensed wildlife rehabilitator and have dealt with pigeons for years.  They are gentle, intelligent birds who are easily tamed.  I have also had doves as pets.  Pigeons have an unwarranted negative reputation and there are a lot of myths about what diseases you may catch from them.  You are much more likely to catch the flu from some inconsiderate person coughing into the air on the subway.  Pigeons also play an important role in the cityâs ecosystem, cleaning up our garbage and providing food for resident hawks and falcons.  Next time people see a pigeon they should take a look at their beautiful iridescent neck feathers and patterns of gray black and often brown feathers.  Anyone wishing to rid their environment of pigeons should keep in mind that poisoning is not only cruel but illegal.  Simple barriers can prevent pigeons from roosting.  Forget the plastic owls.  Pigeons are too smart to be fooled by them!  As you correctly note, pigeons do not carry serious zoonotic diseases that humans can catch.  They are one of the few species of birds that donât carry bird flu.  Letâs try to peacefully co-exist with these beautiful and smart creatures who are part of the cityâs wildlife."
5025,RealEstate,"Please correct the idea that pigeons do not carry infectious zoonotic diseases that people can catch - in fact, they  do, as noted about 5 hours ago. That does not diminish the enjoyment that pigeon fanciers have from working with them, and/or taming them as the person above noted.  But, wild pigeons feed Pale Male, and can infect humans under some circumstances with infectious fungal diseases and molds, none of which should be inhaled - and especially if any given person is not immunocompetent (such as concurrent viral diseases, chemotherapy, comparative age at either end of the spectrum)."

Tomatoes will start to be offered in late June and July, and followed by corn.  Manay of our consumers will be very vocally disappointed.  <br/><br/>In an age where we are accustomed to buying out-of-season fruits and produce imported from warmer areas, it is a constant challenge to help consumers understand the importance of fresh and local.  And how their buying habits not only benefit them, but also support agriculture in New York and the Northeast, as well as the positive economic impact of agriculture.<br/><br/>In our Market we are constantly trying to balance our bakers' offering of lemon loaves, banana breads and brownies, all of which feature ingredients which are not grown locally.  How much do they really support local and regional agriculture?

5046,Well,"This is horrifying. An innocent and seemingly healthy life choice - buying arugula at a local farmers' market - knocked a healthy 22 year old down so hard that she almost needed new kidneys?? It is wonderful that Frances/Maggie is well again, but what can we do to ensure that this problem is prevented in the future?? There must be tougher regulations (is testing produce an option?) on the food we are producing and consuming, whether it is from a local farmers' market or the enormous grocery store down the street. Eating food is something we all do, and we need to be protected. Also, Americans already don't eat enough fruits and vegetables, and this certainly doesn't encourage them to eat anymore than they do now. "
5047,Well,"Even thorough washing does not guarantee that bacteria will be removed from leafy greens such as lettuce.  The contaminated water that carries the bacteria is taken up by the roots of the plant and is present **inside the vascular system (the veins)** of the plant.<br/><br/>As several commenters have pointed out, the source of this virulent bug is grain-fed cattle, whose digestive systems are altered by their artificial diet, resulting in the evolution in their guts of new strains of intestinal bacteria which happen to be extremely toxic to humans."
5048,Well,"For readers posing as experts, I'd suggest reading ""Eating Dangerously"" by Michael Booth.<br/><br/><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18173727-eating-dangerously"" title=""https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18173727-eating-dangerously"" target=""_blank"">https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18173727-eating-dangerously</a>"
5049,Well,"""Iâm a vegetarian, so we know it didnât come from eating meat.""<br/><br/>In a roundabout manner, this infection almost certainly did come from meat. Specifically, the dangerous and antibiotic resistant strain of E. coli (0157:H7) that typically causes HUD, is the result of overuse of antibiotics on cattle back in the 1980s. Cattle are still the primary carriers of the pathogen.<br/><br/>Because cattle are not made ill by the infection, their immune systems do not fight it. Instead, they poop it out throughout their lives, spreading it to plants and animals that come in contact with their feces.<br/><br/>Good composting practices, with frequent and thorough turning, can kill off E. coli O157:H7 before it is spread on fields. Unfortunately, not all farmers are good and careful composters and the big commercial compost sellers do not reliably see that the manure near the surface eventually gets worked into the hot core of the pile. That may have contributed to the poisoned arugula in this frightening tale."
5050,Well,"I have a family member who had E Coli poisoning in 2001. He was young and healthy, but was close to death for weeks, required treatment and follow up for a year, and has had lasting GI problems ever since. His mother was a nurse &amp; he received great care the whole time. <br/><br/>He got this on a camping trip; most of the kids on the trip also got sick, and 2 others were also critically ill. Because so many got sick the state investigated but was not able to conclusively prove what made them sick; but ultimately the suspicion centered on agricultural pollution (cows) upstream of water they swam in. <br/><br/>Food poisoning is nothing to fool around with. Food inspection and safety is a big deal. Water quality is a big deal. <br/><br/>As the Trump administration dismantles these protections keep this in mind. Republicans think these rules are ""bad for business""; and that your death is an acceptable risk to them. Do you?"
5051,Well,"I'm a medical librarian, and after attending numerous teaching and ICU rounds as well as doing hundreds of medical literature searches, I've learned that (1) patients don't read the textbooks so they don't always present with all the proper symptoms and (b) even if they do present with the symptoms of condition x, they're also the symptoms of y, z, d, j, and m. To put it another way, medicine is hard, and sometimes it takes a while to get to the right diagnosis."

5053,Learning,"I consider that I am a procrastinator in every aspect of my life, this is not an option this is some natural behavior sometimes is good because I have time think, plan and design some idea. However, when I have any task for to do at last minute I decide donât do it, the reason is because when I postpone something I never finish and always I give more importance in finish other things and of course my focus change.<br/>My best friend always surprise me because she is too fast and she always putting off everything until the last minute.

5054,Learning,"I have always been a procrastinator and it seems a problem I'm never going to solve. It all started back in the 4th grade with Mrs. McCullough. I had been assigned my first big project, the notorious Science Fair Project. Not really knowing how much time it would take, I waited and waited until the night before it was due. I stayed up 'til 1 or 2 in the morning, which was far past my 7:30 bedtime. Little did I know that this would be the routine for every project and test for the rest of my school career. I've tried many times to break this habit, yet I can't. The best I've done is a temporary fix that lasted for about a couple of weeks. New Years Resolutions, words for the year, and far in advance planning hasn't done the trick. Now, procrastination doesn't mean all I've gotten is bad grades. In fact, that science fair project was picked 3rd in my school and was chosen to compete at the county level. In reality, I got away with procrastination all through elementary and middle school. This is the first year procrastination has really kicked me in the butt. Like my mom has told me on numerous occasions, ""The work is only going to get harder and harder and this habit isn't going to work."" I should've listened a long time ago and I probably wouldn't be sitting with a ""B"" average in AP World or staying up tonight to finish multiple assignments. I know something has got to change or my dreams of making it to a big-time college will be gone. Eventually I'll figure it out, right? "

Many innovations connected to space travel can free us from the internal combustion engine, but the fossil fuel industry is fighting that like crazy. Also, there is not so much of a gulf between the 1% and the rest of the population when it comes to interest in space. I do outreach to thousands of people every year (approx. 5000) and no one says, ""I'm not interested in space."" Rather, it is a universal appeal - the awe and wonder of the Universe.

5081,Travel,"In 2001, I had taken a long, fantastically strange bus trip - from gritty Tijuana, all the way down the Baja peninsula - to glistening, hushed La Paz. <br/><br/>After staying for a few lusciously lazy days - in the brutal heat of late summer, where intense chubascos (sudden downpours) would break the still, afternoon heat - I decided that I'd take the ferry from Pichilingue. It's just up the cove from downtown La Paz, and about halfway to that stunning Balandra Beach that Jada mentioned.<br/><br/>I checked out of my modest pensiÃ³n, got some cheap, tasty food - and an even cheaper gorra (baseball cap). Taking the local bus to the ferry would set me back 15 pesos ($2 US). That was enough decision-making for lunchtime.<br/><br/>I was almost ready to cross the Sea of Cortez; a ferry could take me to either Topolobampo or to MazatlÃ¡n. I lingered in the luxury of not yet deciding which.<br/><br/>I sailed from La Paz on the afternoon of September 9, 2001. The overnight ferry trip landed me in MazatlÃ¡n on the 10th. That next morning of the 11th - traveling solo, in an incredibly warm-hearted, yet foreign country - was very difficult, for not a few reasons. <br/><br/>That rich, tender Mexican generosity that Jada had experienced got me through the next week or so.<br/><br/>Travel does things to one's heart. Loose plans and unexpected events can fuel the wanderlust. It's not danger- but it's not safety, either. It is mystery and wonderment and challenge - often comforting and humbling you to the overwhelming decency of strangers. "
5082,Travel,Never made it to Cabo -- the wife and I lived in Mexico for 24 years and traveled in 30 of the 31 states plus the DF (Mexico City). Don't leave out San Miguel de Allende in your 52!! It's a real jewel!!
5083,Travel,"I am surprised the writer missed, or failed to reveal, that last month the US State Department updated its travel warning for the Mexican state of Baja California Sur, which includes Los Cabos: <br/><br/>""Baja California State â Level 2: Exercise Increased Caution....due to crime. <br/><br/>""Criminal activity and violence, including homicide, remain an issue throughout the state. According to the ... Secretariat for Public Security, the state experienced an increase in homicide rates compared to the same period in 2016. While most of these homicides appeared to be targeted, criminal organization assassinations, turf battles between criminal groups have resulted in violent crime in areas frequented by U.S. citizens. Bystanders have been injured or killed in shooting incidents."" <br/><br/>The author also failed to mention that in December four bodies, possibly victims of cartel violence, were found hanging from bridges along the highways leading to Cabo San Lucas. <br/><br/>Los Cabos may have many charms, but readers surely deserve a clearer and fuller disclosure of all of the risks, not only the benefits, of the 52 ""idyllic"" spots chosen for this series. Any savvy traveler--and travel writer--knows to check State Department travel advisories before embarking on what might be an adventure--or a nightmare. As for road travel at night in Baja (or amost anywhere outside major Mexican cities), fuggeddabouddit. <br/><br/>Future articles in this series would benefit from improved author research and editorial supervision."
5084,Travel,"I was in Los Cabos once.  I was supposed to be there for 10 days or so.  After 2 nights I was bored;  bars, a limited beach selection, decadence.  I rented a VW bug and drove north, up the eats side of the peninsula, down the west side.  That was one of the best under-two-week  adventures I have ever had.  Mexico at it's finest."
5085,Travel,"When I drove south from San Diego I didn't know what to expect in Baja. I met a young man who on a previous trip travelled by bicycle from the San Francisco Bay area to Southern California eating nothing but what he could forage or pick.  He said he asked the farmers if he could have some of their crop and they always said yes.   He ate mostly figs.  When we got further south on the peninsula I slept under a Palapa and he and a friend slept under the stars.  The land looked like a different planet in many places.  People that noticed us were friendly and kind, those that didn't were busy and indifferent.   We never did make it all the way to the south tip but I remember La Paz and Loreto.  The map doesn't lie; It is a very long way but I had plenty of time back then.  That place had a great effect on me.  I can't imagine living like that here in the U.S., I hope that some do though.  I want to say more but it's very late.  Buenas Noches. "
5086,Travel,    It looks beautiful. Thank you for sharing!
5087,Travel,"I had high hopes for this series. No more. It seems like a high speed chase to check the boxes in the best of list of what to see at each of the stops. The true essence of discovery is lost: nothing is truly observed or understood, nothing is learned. The experience of travel is diminished and banalized. "
5088,Travel,"Crikey! This is scary!, gonna have to pass on the Cabo. And driving at night in Mexico is always, always, always  a bad idea."
5089,Travel,Thank you for describing the true meaning and possibilities of travel.

5094,RealEstate,Wonderful!  Any stories about a couple that make $45K/yr?
5095,RealEstate,"âIâm on Zillow a lot...Itâs not for everyone; itâs definitely for me.â<br/><br/>She's definitely clueless in that department, if she has not realized that zillow is definitely for EVERYONE. (Every neighbors in the neighborhood wants to know how much everyone's property is worth, to say the least. That's how they size up the Joneses.)<br/><br/>She might think she's special, but the only thing that sounds out of ordinary, is the fact that they have ready capital of $750k to buy something on a snap, and then another $140k on renovations. The only worry on her mind? First baby on its way! How nice it is to live in a world where money is no object. It's such a passive-aggressive way to gloat about her superior station in life.<br/><br/>I don't say this out of green envy. Back in 2010, I came across a house quite by accident, one week before a planned months-long summer vacation aboard. Market was only climbing itself back out from the '08 big mess, realtors were eager, seller was more than willing (after seeing three prior offers fell through, one by one), hence my totally lowballed offer (which I never expected it to be considered) was accepted within a couple of hours which was a surprise to me. The whole process, except the actual closing, took place while I was out of the country, but it was breeze. That was the best snap decisions I've ever made. But no, it wasn't $750k. And, putting this in print or media is definitely in the category of ""over-sharing"" to me. Some things should stay private."
5096,RealEstate,"Three weeks?<br/>Please come to our home!<br/>Love the yellow door, we have the same shade of yellow on ours as well."
5097,RealEstate,so much white with a toddler about to toddle about - it's all lovely though.  For now. 
5098,RealEstate,"This article is so tone deaf ""...they have no regrets about buying a house they didnât intend to buy or doing landscaping they hadnât planned on,"" because most people spend $750k on a summer house so they don't have to drive 6 hours round trip from a job, and sink another $140k on renovations and landscaping, while renovating their main residence and negotiating a real estate contract from Paris.  It's a lovely home and wonderful that their hard work has allowed them this luxury, but this article is too bourgeois for its own good."
5099,RealEstate,"As someone who has lived in East Hampton full time for the past 20 years, I found this article quite amusing.  Only people with a very substantial and steady NYC income could afford to wave a magic wand to redo a (relatively) simple house which already cost 3/4 of a million dollars.  We bought our house 25 years ago and are now waiting for buyers like this to descend and do what we have not been able to over the years."
5100,RealEstate,I hate it that they cut down trees. Trees absorb carbons and are habitats for wildlife. They provide shade in the summer as a natural AC.  They help combat climate change.  Trees add aesthetic beauty and increase property value.   It is a shame that they were cut down. 
5101,RealEstate,I appreciate the down to earth aspect of this article. It's only the earth they're coming down to is so much richer and privileged than the earth that most of us inhabit. Doesn't the NYT know anyone who's not a millionaire?
5102,Magazine,"I would not bike or walk to work because my hair would be a wreck and I would be too sweaty and smelly to be around my co-workers. I live in the suburbs and have a one hour commute by car. All the time I saved would be spent showering and re-coiffing, make upping plus I'd have to carry my clothes, hair dryer, makeup, towel etc. Not practical."
5103,Magazine,"I am 72 years  old, since 1988 I biking on a regular basis, 5 days a week, 15 miles per day, commuting when the Miami weather permitted.  Since retiring in 2009, it's 7 days a week, 6-15 miles per day, wind and rain permitting. <br/><br/>13 years ago, I faced cancer and a prostate removal operation. The morning of my planned hospital release I had  pulmonary embolism blockages. One lung was at 75% capacity, the other almost completely blocked. My BP was very low and dropping,  my heart rate peaked at 170. But, as the nurse hit the blue button on the wall, my pressure stabilized and my heart rate ""dropped"" to 140.  That old pump, use to daily 120-135 bpm workouts, just kept on a ticken'.  <br/><br/>2 years later I faced a return of the cancer and ""salvage radiation."" The weather cooperated, letting me bike to each of my 37 radiation treatments. <br/><br/>This past month, my family physician recommended a routine screening for heart disease(CT calcium artery scanning of the heart). My  test BP was normal, 120/70. The test result? Total for the heart was 0.0 Agaston units, ""corresponding to the 100th percentile for age and gender"" for coronary artery calcification (zero units measured.""  <br/><br/>Pre-1988, I would do my exercise  at a health club. Biking was  recreational.  That plan  was replaced by the far cheaper option of  biking as the go-to travel option when distance and rain/wind permitted. The result? My family physician said it best: ""You're in a sweet spot.""   Thank you Trek!"
5104,Magazine,"I LOVE LOVE LOVE biking to work. But I didn't start doing it until Citibike (bike-share) came to my neighborhood. It's fast, it is a great way to start the day, it's good for the planet, and it makes me feel good. I do it year-round unless it is raining or there is snow on the ground. I don't care if it's cold or hot. I don't bike in the dark, though, which means that in the winter, I don't bike home."
5105,Magazine,"I cycled to work in Nashville for several years and loved it. My biggest problems: Driving staring at cellphones who wouldn't look up to see me waving at them at an intersection, not wanting to move until they saw me, and a coworker who disliked seeing me come in the door sweaty and head for the shower in the back of our office. She ultimately put the quietus on my rides to work because she complained so much I was asked to stop using the shower. You can't bike to work in Tennessee in the summer and not take a shower after you get there."
5106,Magazine,"Just visited my brother in Seattle, he bikes to work, but they have an incredible system of bike paths, as well as respect for cyclists, which Louisville lacks.  I canât forget the cyclist killed on the bridge to Indiana, which is where I commute to. Nor can I forget the German cyclist who was killed by the former First Lady of Kentucky; she kept her position as spokesperson for the American Automobile Association. "
5107,Magazine,"Um, as a woman, I value my personal safety above anything else. I would no more walk or ride a bike to work than the man in the moon. Also, most jobs I have had expected me to show up looking clean and smelling fresh. There is no chance that I would walk or bike to work or home in the dark, in the rain, in the blistering humid heat of summer or in below-freezing weather. And I sure as heck donât want to get kidnapped, raped or robbed walking anywhere alone. Inside my car, I am protected from weather and the vagaries of crime. "

5110,Learning,"My home is where I feel best able to express myself. There, I am surrounded by family, I know we have seen all of each otherâs sides: the good, the bad, and the ugly. We may tease each other, but we are always accepting of one another no mater how crazy we are. We have grown up together and they have had my back through everything. My family has seen me at two in the morning bouncing all over the walls and seen me at 6 in the morning looking completely dead as i get ready for school. They already know how I act and look in most situations and nothing surprises them anymore. My family has been there for everything and I know that no matter what, they will always be there. I convey my thoughts, questions, ideas, and emotions very loudly at home and chaotic. I know that my family is the same and we may seem crazy and out of control to anyone outsider lolking in, but we get each other and we like it that way. "
5111,Learning,"I do not believe that school is a place to express yourself, schools are insitutions set in place to educate students unbiasedly.  Allowing self expression will force students to be exposed to opinions and beliefs that will harm their ability to learn.  I was only encouraged to express myself when i entered college. Before this i was not, this is because, opinionated writing is not the most coherent and teachers are not supposed to push opinions on young mind which is usually what happens when teachers allow opinions to enter writing. Personally I try to seperate my opinions from my writing so that I stay on topic and can provide unbiased information."
5112,Insider,I wasn't born in Texas but I got there as soon as I could.
5113,Insider,Luckily when my wife and I faced this situation (at the time living on the upper westside) I fortuitously was offered a job in the town where I grew up -- Houston.  Thus the 9th generation of Texicans was born into my family.  
5114,Insider,"We'd be better off as a nation if Texans were a little les chauvinistic about their state, and thought first of their country."
5115,Insider,"I wish I had known about this 30 years ago. My 3 NYC born children would have had Texas dirt at their birth's had I been this clever.  However they have been to the Houston Livestock show and Rodeo enough to get sufficient ""dirt"" under their feet."
5116,Insider,"Having visited Texas many time, please let me say the only redeeming part of that state is Austin.<br/>Otherwise, itâs a state that worships ignorance and the rich.<br/>Iâd strongly support Trumpâs plan for a wall - if he built in on Texasâ north border. "
5117,Insider,There is just no place like Texas! My family is seventh generation in our little Texas town and I am very proud!
5118,Insider,"This story made me cry. When my Texas friend was murdered in Brooklyn, she was buried there. Her mother flew to the funeral with a bag of Texas dirt and sprinkled it on the fresh grave."
5119,Insider,"Let it be known should someone have a child in Jerusalem, Israel, try to be near the Wailing Wall. As EL PASO is on the exact same Latitude as Jerusalem. Little known fact EL PASO is known as Jerusalem of the West."
5120,Insider,"As a labor and delivery nurse in NYC, I attended the birth of a baby that was similarly anointed in its first moments of life. As I recall, the Texas dirt was contained in a tin sunglasses container, not a bag. I smiled at the idea then, just as Iâm smiling at this article now. "
5121,Insider,"Get a life. This was a cute story.<br/><br/>Texans are not alone in fiercely defending and loving their home cities and states. New Yorkers certainly consider themselves superior. <br/><br/>Although I no longer live in Texas, for a number of reasons, I still love many things about the state and the people."
5122,Express,Fear of change.  My family's non-college educated Trump voters are doing just fine economically.  Fear spread by Fox News keeps them going but the basic fear was there to be stoked.
5123,Express,"This fear of loss of status was especially apparent to us LGBT folk during the marriage equality push in the early 2000s. It became increasingly clear that a lot of the so-called Christian Right (almost entirely white) required that the state validate the superior status of their marriages. It even came down to usage of the word, âmarriage,â to distinguish their unions as morally superior to ours. <br/><br/>In our household, especially during the time of the marriage equality debates where our two children were bombarded with messages that their family was somehow inferior to those of their peers, weâve tried to teach them that they must always first seek validation from within. When someone seeks external validation, we told them, it is because they are incapable of finding it internally. It is a sign of deep seated insecurity."
5124,Express,"What got this âdominantâ class to this state of fragile insecurity? Six years of a popular and socially responsible black president? Well, tough. Enjoy your little temper tantrum until November, entitled ones..."
5125,Express,"Duh. It's obvious that the white man's identity angst is part of what drives the stupid train in American politics right now, but the over-riding global picture is economic inequality. A pity that insecure people are driven to shoot themselves and a whole nation in the foot to pretend they have some kind of control over the situation."
5126,Express,Sounds like many white men like me have been pondering the possibility of racial karma. I never do like the conclusions I draw from such musings. Would it help if we said we were sorry? 
5127,Express," This particular study aside, the horror and fascination with how Donald Trump won the presidency will no doubt continue because its so anathema to so many...  The simpler the answer the happier most people will be. The conclusion here suits most readers of the NYTImes just fine so it must be right. End of story.  Obviously.  Maybe, however, just maybe there should be more studies on just why Hillary Clinton failed to win.  I'd like to see a more detailed autopsy report on her campaign."
5128,Express,"The good news here is that about , by my rough calculation, 1600  American white males die every day (I am a 72 year -old ,white male).  Since about 60% of us voted for Trump, that takes out his victory margin every few months or so.  Younger voters will hopefully not catch my generation's emotionally crippling fear and resentment. "
5129,Express,Humans having been roaming from one place to another on this earth since the beginning.  It is hopeless and a waste of precious living time to fight the overpowering sway of cultural changes.  All the past cultures that thrived for awhile and are no more should be lessons to people who voted for Trump out of fear of change.  Do yourselves a favor and take a class in linguistics.   Life is change.
5130,Express,Ironic that the fear of America losing its dominance in the world has caused so many people to support a man who has done more to damage Americaâs dominance in the world than any other.
5131,Express,"âIt used to be a pretty good deal to be a white, Christian male in America, but things have changed and I think they do feel threatened,â Dr. Mutz said.""<br/><br/>This is and will continue to be the best deal going for generations. Feeling threatened and being threatened are two totally different things. Unleashing Trump on the world is a horrible replacement for a therapist. "
5132,Express,"How do we combat this threat? I think we do it by presenting an optimistic, inclusive vision where all Americans, including white Christian men, feel they have a seat at the table and are respected. We need a leader who will appeal to people's better angels, not pander to their fears. This is why I miss Obama."
5133,Express,"I just saw this in a documentary about Gloria Steinem.  She was on Oprah with some other women advocating for more representation in government with a goal of 50%...makes sense as women are 50% of the population.  (I know women are slightly more but close enough.)<br/>A white guy in the audience was called on to speak and he said --and I'll paraphrase as I don't have it in front of me-- ""how do you think we feel?  It's like you are trying to take over?""  <br/><br/>Really?  Women actually know because we have had so little representation.<br/>And 50% is taking over?  No.  Men actually took over!  "
5134,Express,"Fascinating study.  We all have Trump supporting relatives and friends.  This study makes me reevaluate their Trump support.  They all complain about the economy, but all are doing well.  On second evaluation, I do think their support of Trump really is based on some misplaced feeling about their reduced status in society, supporting this study.  They just don't want to say it, or they are unaware of it.  They are not sociologists, after all.<br/><br/>If the study that Niraj Chokshi reports about here is accurate, it's probably bad news for Republicans.  As our society diversifies, as it has always done, the number of people who feel uncomfortable with diversity will gradually decline.<br/><br/>Where I live is a diverse community.  And my mostly Trump-supporting family in the South and Midwest includes Pentecostals, Episcopals, Mormons, Methodists, Muslims, Jews and atheists.  The Jewish, Muslim and atheist contingents are not Trump-supporting.  <br/><br/>In determining who the Trump supporter is, education is another factor that would correlate with a subject's fear of reduced status."
5135,Express,As Australian visitors we drove around Trump Territory in 9 Southern US states last year<br/><br/>the anger and resentment on the faces of poor white men there suggested their feeling - 'I may be poor white trash - but at least I'm not black'<br/><br/>fear of being lumped in with the lowest of the low may explain their joy at announcements about a Mexican Wall (despite Texan farmers wanting/needing Mexican workers) - irrational fear ignoring economic reality<br/><br/>I understood that many poor white folk in the Deep South could get better paying jobs if they just moved to where the jobs are - but no they choose to stay where their roots are - small-minded small communities where other whites are like them - united against the 'other'.
5136,Express,"Biblical scholar, Walter Brueggemann, wrote about this in the late 1990s in his book ""Cadences of Home Preaching Among Exiles.""  He noted that changes in the American landscape will leave some people, particularly older, white men, feeling exiled in their own country.  He saw its metaphor in Judah's exile from Jerusalem in 586 BCE.<br/><br/>He wrote, ""...exiles experienced a loss of the structured, reliable world which gave them meaning and coherence, and they found themselves in a context where their most treasured symbols of faith were mocked, trivialized, or dismissed.  Exile is not primarily geographical, but is social, moral, and cultural.""<br/><br/>We can create new structures and meaning by re-imagining old structures and meanings.  We should engage our imaginations in order to break free of long-standing traditional narratives to re-interpret them and engage them in creative ways."
5137,Express,"âIf you can convince the lowest white man heâs better than the best colored man, he wonât notice youâre picking his pocket. Hell, give him somebody to look down on, and heâll empty his pockets for you.â - President Lyndon Baines Johnson "
5138,Express,Just a question to Niraj Chokshi--did the voter surveys mentioned include both men and women? I found it difficult to tell if only white men were concerned about loss of status or also white women?
5139,Express,"Or so that [false] narrative went. <br/><br/>Does anyone with any sense of sanity believe any of the pre-election rubbish at this point and time? If you do, well as they say, Iâve got a bridge..."
5140,Express,"Ah, White Fear."
5141,Express,"Duh! Anyone who ever spoke to more then a few White male Trumplodites knew this. Wow...the white privilege they felt was waning was all I've ever heard about from the Trumplodites I know. (and to tell the truth their female partners, were more vile in their expression of same) <br/><br/>The Wall, all about keeping the dilution factor out.<br/>The Immigrant War - all about the loss of white male privilege.<br/>Travel Ban...same. As Trumplodites see any immigrants as getting special treatment, that they believe is their right. <br/><br/>The Economic anxiety argument was mostly from the pundits and press trying to clean up the language. <br/><br/>Leveling the playing field, in any way, has always been viewed as taking from white xtian males. And by extension their wives and family. <br/><br/>Im glad this study was done, and printed - but I'll say it anyway, Duh! <br/><br/>Its time for the media, and the Dems to start talking as plainly as Trump and his sycophant base. "
5142,Express,"It is easy to say that Trump voters were ""racist"", ""stupid"", or afraid.  These are derogatory terms thrown around by the other side obviously.  They make liberals feel superior and righteous, despite having lost the election.<br/><br/>What we fail to even consider is that Trump America was also angry, in much the same way liberal America is now with Trump in control.  Trump promised to end everything that Obama created.  For the 8 years Obama was president, there was a huge portion of the United States that disagreed with his politics and enacted laws, but were powerless to do anything about.  There was huge anger over that.   To simply use terms like ""racist"" or ""stupid"" is just a way for us to write that off and discard it or their views as meaningless without considering them.   <br/><br/>We may not agree with them, but there is a huge problem in our country when it becomes okay to ignore and marginalize 49% of the population, when the other 51% just happened to have gained political power. It goes both ways.  All Americans deserve better than that."
5143,Express,"Well when you saw the pics of the cars lined up to get into his rallies, you could clearly see they were not hurting financially.  <br/><br/>The only people that have to blame for perceived or real loss of status is themselves.  The fastest declining group attending institutions of higher learning are white males.  The fastest growing are black females.  <br/><br/>Don't they ever wonder why the GOP has persuaded them to distrust our educational institutions?  Or to hate the Common Core?  Many of them STILL argue that the CC is a curriculum that pushes ""liberal readings"" on their kids.  Nope.  It is a set of standards that makes kids think.  So guess whose kids are going  to be doing rhetorical analysis and whose aren't?   "
5144,Express,"I'm white and Christian and could not vote for Trump.  in the next Life, who knows I may come back as cheap reproduction of a Louis the XIV in his servant's quarters."
5145,Express,"No doubt that the hatred which is Donald Trump's stock in trade served him well in validating the fears and hatred in many feeble-minded voters.  And that he was able to extend that hatred onto Hillary Clinton who responded with feeble apologies and cowering in the safe space of the donor class, rendering herself a tailor made punching bag to be showered with abuse by Donald Trump every night on national TV"
5146,Express,Bernie Sanders was doing us all a disservice when he kept insisting that Clinton couldn't appeal to white working class men because she didn't understand their fear of losing jobs.  A lot of other things were going on.  
5147,Express,"Word to the Trump voters, in a democracy, privilege is something you earn, not born with.  By virtue of your skin color certain advantages are inherent but if you do not succeed, if you do not strive, invent, excel and make it in society then your 'privilege' diminishes when others succeed where you don't.<br/>Status is earned by success.  That others succeed is not at your expense.  It is because they try harder, take advantage of education, re-training and hard work.<br/>Trump doesn't have a magic wand.  He is a carnival barker and mostly invented.  That you continue to follow him despite the evidence you've not paid attention to is why you lose and others win.  He took you, got what he wanted and left you behind.<br/>If life gives you a challenge you need to meet it, not expect it to bolster you while you do little or nothing to enhance it.<br/>Wake up, drop the hate and do something positive for yourselves and the country you say you love.  Be better."
5148,Express,"Didn't we already know that Trump was elected because he appealed to the racism, misogyny, homophobia, xenophobia, transphobia and religious bigotry of conservative White Christians in Red State America?  People who just can't handle an egalitarian level playing field and grew up feeling that they deserve to be deferred to by the rest of America."
5149,Express,"This is what I have been saying for a few years now! Economic issues are important, but the root cause of the pro-Trump/anti-Trump divide is the cultural divide in our country. This cultural divide extends from views on the changing demographics to places such as music. For example Spotify said that last year, rap was the most listened-to genre. There probably aren't too many Trump supporters who know who J. Cole is. Additionally, it's safe to say not too many anti-Trump Americans watch Duck Dynasty or too many Trump supporters watch Atlanta. Our divisions have permeated everything and we are now in a severe culture war. With Trump's attacks on our institutions and a lack of a shared culture, what is there to bring us together anymore?"
5150,Express,"I sense some whites fear people of color, such as Obama, who have had success at elite schools.  Statistically, however, the enrollment at the various elite universities has barely increased since the 1960's and 1970's.  The rate of increase varies between 2 to 8 percent.  In some schools, the enrollment has dropped.<br/><br/>Prior to the 1970's, people like George W. Bush performed poorly, academically, yet were admitted into Yale and Harvard.  Thus, there was an affirmative action for the wealthy.  <br/><br/>My personal physician grew up in a part of my city that was not affluent.  He is Hispanic and a double graduate of Stanford.  He is recognized as one of the top doctors in San Antonio.  I chose him because of his ability and I had to beg to be one of his patients because his practice is so successful.  I am glad he did not let prejudice determine who his patients are.  <br/><br/>I thought the greatness of our country was that people could be like my physician.  "
5151,Express,"Why is it not possible that it was a number of issues that compelled folks to vote for Trump, some legitimate and others of less noble intent? Why do pundits always want it to have been one single issue? "
5152,Express,"the fear some whites have is similar to the fear by the Taliban, Isis, other conservative groups everywhere... fear of change, of modernity, of equality for all... but the change is inevitable, progress inevitable, time marches on and eventually ""the last shall be first""...oh, someone already said that.  "
5153,Express,So it was fear of the non-white non-Christian after all............
5154,Express,"It's lazy and cynical to wag our fingers and shout ""racist."" There were 62.9 million people who voted for Trump, and there were a multitude of reasons why people were motivated (or conned, thanks Russia) into voting for him. Using this article as a basis to confirm and further retreat into one's polarized worldview is sad. Trump is a disgrace, and the world is complex; stop being simpletons.   "
5155,Express,Guess it was those damn deplorables after all.
5156,Express,"Trump voters are worried most about loss of status? Hilarious. If they were not already in that category, they self-demoted themselves to white trash the moment they decided to vote for for this horrible president. "
5157,Express,"I could certainly confirm this by my work experience in male-dominated fields.  Men have a hierarchy established; minority men fall automatically at the bottom where they tend to stay.  Women (whom I think intuitively work more cooperatively) confuse this hierarchy for white men because they are not seen as being on the ladder at all.  Women are then treated like aliens and frozen out of work relationships.  <br/><br/>And frozen out is the best you are treated unless, God forbid, you are actually as good as or better at their jobs.  Then, jealousy sets in and it's worse.<br/><br/>I was also surprised to notice that even many liberal men also assume that women and minorities only reach higher places because of some sort of ""affirmative hiring program"" as they think it can't possibly be that any woman or minority person could be smarter or more qualified than they.  <br/><br/>That also explains the success of Republican propaganda among their following to dismiss Obama as simply a ""community organizer"" and Hillary Clinton as ""wife of a former president""  We like to think that civil rights movements have changed everything, but not really.  <br/><br/>As much as I've tried to tell my local rabid Republicans that the youngest generation is majority minority and ""white"" people will not be the dominant force in the coming years, they refuse to listen.  They see it as some sort of ""race war"" but that war is already lost to them.  In the mean time, they vote to the right and we all get to suffer the consequences. "
5158,Express,"For many, many years women, gays, people with dark skins, people of non Christian religions, and others were ignored or belittled (and in some cases suffered much worse)  and nobody paid much  attention.    Now we find that white men feel threatened and everyone is in a tizzy.   If they feel threatened then they can join the crowd of other people who feel threatened or miss treated or disadvantaged.    Trump wants to bring back coal and manufacturing.    But they say that thousands of retail and clerical workers will lose jobs because of automation and online ordering/home delivery.   Is trump going to bring back retail?<br/><br/>The way to deal with trump and those who favor a privileged position for white males is for everyone to go to the polls and vote every time there is an election.    A failing of many democrats is to always think of some reason not to vote on election day.   Whenever there is a strong democratic candidate, the republicans are going to fire up the smear machine and run it 24/7.   Hillary Clinton was not a good politician and had her problems but the republicans had run the Hillary smear machine for about 20 years and some democrats bought into it.    Some said that Hillary did not display sufficient empathy.   Does trump display any empathy?<br/><br/>I am a white Christian male but I think that everyone should be treated fairly and equally.      American society is becoming more diverse by the day and that is good.     "
5159,Express,"Let us say what we mean here. To talk about anxiety, fear of what may come, loss of status, etc. is beating around the proverbial bush. What this article is about is bigotry.<br/><br/>W.A.S.P. nativists are afraid of loosing their social edge. They 'are concerned about' (fear) people whose skin, speech, religion, dress, sexuality, and/or attitudes are ""different"". So they wear their flags, cheer on Trump, and police &amp; military brutality, rant about the supposed protections of The Wall and guns for teachers, and the 'deep state' conspiracy to take away everything they treasure. <br/><br/>Their feared 'deep state' is actually simple demographics. The country is becoming a steadily more pluralistic nation while they use coded language to drive fear. Demographics - it is why they now fear democracy. What will happen when the country is no longer majority-us? They think of it as 'status'. It is bigotry."
5160,Express,"This is genuinely one of the least substantial, self-satisfied âstudiesâ Iâve seen trotted out since the election. Some people voted for Obama and then voted for Trump. A whole lot more people voted for Obama and didnât show up at the polls for Hillary. How many Bernie or bust supporters didnât come out? How many of these studies would be trotted out if Hillary got the extra 77,000 votes on top of her popular vote landslide? Iâd venture not quite so many. Economic anxiety feeds cultural anxiety. When economic need cannot be satisified people look for new ways to feel good about themselves. Germany and Hitler? There is a reason college educated liberal America doesnât get swept up in this stuff â weâre doing well! Weâre âthe good peopleâ. We tell ourselves all the time! And we say things we know to be vacuous and disingenuous: âthe economy is growingâ! Yes, but for whom? Not our uber drivers or our task rabbits or the rustbelt factory just automated. The future is going in one direction and its only a matter of time before âgoodâ liberals start feeling and voting on the same economic anxiety some Trump voters felt. Your lawyer, your accountant, and your doctor will be an algorithm. And this will create a new economic version of âwhen they came for x, I said nothing for I wasnât x...when they came for me, who was left?â "
5161,Express,"Trump voters are in fear of losing their status?... And just what status might that be?<br/>Is there actually any status in being a racist, and supporting a racist president?<br/>The mind boggles."
5162,Express,"I hope that in the next couple of election cycles the NYT resists its propensity for false equivalence and the lure of a horserace to garner sales.  If not then you are no different from Trump saying that there are ""fine people on both sides""."
5163,Express,"It might. Sorry or caught up in your own stuff and unaware. Just like in a partner relationship, no one likes to be told theyâre not seeing what theyâre seeing or theyâre âdreamingâ slights or belittlements.<br/><br/>Yeah, if weâre serious about getting along and if your comment is serious, I think acknowledging past wrongs and sincerely attempting to right those wrongs would go a long way. <br/><br/>If itâs not too late. "
5164,Express,"And the fact Hillary was a women had NOTHING to do with it?  The sexism is so normalized, so pervasive and ubiquitous, that you don't even think to mention it!!"
5165,Express,"a privilege is taken for granted as a right, it is not appreciated until there is sense of losing the privilege. Those who does not have the privilege see it clearly all the time."
5166,Express,"Unpopular corrupt cronies like DeVos and Pruitt?<br/><br/>Dems are the ones who back social security, balanced trade, and higher wages.<br/><br/>You think $1.40 a week, destroying the soybean trade, and privatizing social security are centrist or populist. Bless your heart. "
5167,Express,"So you saddled us, and yourself, with Trump in order to punish the media. Great."
5168,Express,"Mtnman me: and there you have it, the whole conflict in one thread. <br/><br/>The truth is not inherently hateful - itâs just the truth. Even an old ethnic white man like yours truly can see that- Iâm glad I got enough eddycation. "
5169,Express,"The Trump converts were convinced by Mercer's stooges, Bannon and the orange buffoon that they are victims. Religious victims, victims of the Mexicans, victims of the Chinese, victims of the government, victims of the terrorists, victims of the system, victims of the media.  Their entire persona is one of matyrdom and grievence.  They are mainly victims of their own gross stupidity."
5170,Express,"Yet the current occupant of the White House is rethinking his stand on TPP, he is now for it. Your argument is collapsing."
5171,Express,"As a liberal who has, I strongly suspect, picked more potatoes, baled more hay, hoed more tobacco, built more farm silos, and painted and remodelled more houses than you, Mr. Cohen, I find your last paragraph idiotic.   "
5172,Express,"When people say ""Make America Great Again"" and ""lets go back to when things were simple"" they are referring to the times when they were children and had zero responsibilities. My father and uncles (all Trump voters) wax nostalgic all the time about the 1950s and how great they were. Why? Because they were children. Life is pretty great when you can play, not worry about a job, etc.."
5173,Express,"What the article ""establishes"" is more media content that adds nothing to our understanding of each other in this democratic society.  Today's issue of the New York Times seems particularly reliant on headlines more than  on content and on promoting thin/tired subject matter."
5174,Express,"Maybe donât let our oligarchy divide people so â not every whites person wants to be a âbossâ to take away something from you, thatâs the billionaires talking from Trumps government, the billionaires who have themselves a trillion dollars of your/our tax money for themselves while demanding single mothers work 30 hours a week before weâll give them food stamps.<br/>The billionaires, dude, are who is speaking. "
5175,Express,You hit the nail on the head!<br/>The fear of having their mediocrity exposed. 
5176,Express,"Perhaps I missed something.  Did Republicans declare resistance when Obama was elected?  Did they prevent people from attending the inauguration?  Did they organize resistance marches?  Did the Republicans in the Senate refuse to confirm Obama appointees?  [They confirmed six on inauguration day and another seven within the week.  It took over two months for 13 Trump cabinet members to be confirmed, thanks to Democrats exercising their right to blather for 30 hours to an empty Senate for each appointment, Harry Reid having denied them the ability to filibuster.]<br/><br/>Republicans did nothing to obstruct Obama until after his fatally flawed and unpopular Obamacare cost Pelosi the ability to order Democrats to vote for a bill so they could find out what was in it.  Boehmler's famous ""objective is to make Obama a one term President"" was made in November 2010.<br/><br/>The ""racist rage"" erupted in 2015, after six years of Obama excoriating the police forces in Democrat enclaves for racism.  Hmm, all of the BLM riots occurred in cities that had been governed by Democrats for decades. "
5177,Express,Or rather the stupidity.  But don't discount the hatred and ignorance and prejudice and entitlement.
5178,Express,"I have a wealthy in-law who is a highly educated dentist.  He voted fro Trump and was constantly trying to tell my sister how horrible Hillary was, and how her  utter and complete horriblenessness was not due to her being a woman, at all.  and Trump was great bc he had no experience in politics and was a businessman."
5179,Express,"I donât think you read the article right. Those voters were not reacting to a lose of status of the kind you describe: wealth, health care, or even guns... as the study says, they were not worse off in an objective quantifyable way. They see that they are not the center of their universe anymore, that they are not the majority anymore and that people around them look less and less like themselves. And sorry but I canât sympathise with that."
5180,Express,It's locker room talk.

5182,Washington,"If the allegations are true, the Navy should court martial Dr. Jackson"
5183,Washington,Trump is an idiot. There is no way this guy is a billionaire. He's not astute. He has no ability to look at both sides of anything. All problems are someone else's fault. He's really a coward....afraid to confront anyone (unless you count his brave tweet storms.) He's just a miserable person.

5188,Foreign,What about the American he paid homage to--Elliot Rodger? Do you wonder about his ethnic roots or religion? 
5189,Dining,Serious pretense. Usually a restaurant critic addresses the effects of food on the palate. Little of that here. Hence the very controversial reactions by the many commentators. About the ants: they are not alive or covered in chocolate. They are ground! for those who are shocked by the idea of eating ants.<br/>No algae are mentioned. Too bad. They will become the food of the future when all else is no longer available. Meanwhile let the divers pluck the bottom of the sea for scallops and shells. Too bad no octopus seems to visit the far north . . . I love to be embraced by it (ch)arms.  
5190,Dining,"I guess Denmark is not as socialist as I thought<br/><br/>$375 sans drinks could feed about 300 people a meal at a soup kitchen I am on the board of<br/><br/>The rise of this restaurant occurred in the same period that poverty nearly doubled in Denmark. <br/><br/>The cost of living in Denmark is close to the highest in the world, and this restaurant doesnât seem to help that statistic. "
5191,Dining,No thanks...more than a little pretentious....
5192,Dining,"As an indigent vegetarian for whom no meal is complete without bread, I know that I'll never be dining at Noma. Usually I have a cynical chuckle when I read reviews of such expensive places, but Pete Wells's snark-free (though nicely amusing) piece has made me understand why gourmet omnivores might want to go there. There's a hotel near me with off-season room (not suite) rates starting at $700 â no food, not even breakfast, included. It'll never be a decision I'll have to make, but if I were to choose between spending $375 on several hours' worth of delicious dining or almost double that for eight hours with my eyes closed, I'd opt for the former."
5193,Dining,"Thank you Mr. Wells!  Reading this painted a lovely picture in my head of what it must be like to eat at Noma.  While Noma is out of my price range, I do appreciate the creative minds that put together such beautiful, locally sourced and sustainable food, and the beautiful venues in which to sample them.<br/>I had the pleasure of bumping into Mr. Redzepi in Copenhagen a few weeks ago.  I'd heard about his former colleague Rosio Sanchez' taqueria, Hija de Sanchez, from an episode of Chef's Night Out, and then again in an episode of Ugly Delicious.  So when I had the opportunity to visit Copenhagen last month, I made a lunchtime stop at Ms. Sanchez' taqueria an absolute must.  To my surprise, as I arrived at the tiny taqueria, there sitting in the sun on a particularly sunny April day (and sitting not in a chair but directly on the sidewalk no less), was Mr. Redzepi and Ms. Sanchez.  I didn't pass up the opportunity to go over and say hello.  They were very warm and gracious, with not a single sign of ""celebrity chef"" arrogance.  They were also kind enough to take a picture with me!  So if you're ever in Copenhagen, and can't get a table at Noma, give the more affordable Hija de Sanchez a try.  The tacos are incredible!"
5194,Dining,"I had the pleasure of eating there last month with a couple of chefs from the US.<br/>The meal, unlike anything I have ever eaten before was amazing. The attention to detail and the explanations of where the food came from were totally appropriate as part of the experience. The idea that Rene is serving ""Cheap cuts"" is ludicrous. If you are lucky enough to see his test kitchen and fermentation rooms you would understand the price.<br/>Yes the price does makes it super exclusive but everything was so original and satisfying that you walked away feeling sated and happy.<br/>Mr. Well's review was spot on."
5195,Dining,"I ate at Noma 2.0 in March and I can honestly say, that the price is the last thing I think of when recalling the evening. From the personal welcome to the food, from the service to the tour of the restaurant, from the known to the adventure - it was without a doubt the most complete and next-level dining experience I have ever had. And yes, all the dishes are exeptional. Some of them might sound weird and as if they are only being served for the purpose of being weird - but trust me, they are all served for their taste. This is what truly great chefs do. I hope to get a seat for the autumn season as well.  "
5196,Dining,"Why? I read it once. That's enough. There is nothing in the review that indicates the menu cost, air travel charges, and lodging required are worth the time and effort. The restaurant is not something the world needs or desires. <br/><br/>It's a shallow and pretentious place best mocked by Monty Python. The fact that Mr. Redzepi also charges culinary students a high rate indicates where his loyalties lie. Cash in the wallet is all he cares about. <br/><br/>I'd love to know what his food costs are when you factor in ants, wild herbs found next to a walking path, and the worst part of a cod. <br/><br/>The whole thing is weak joke or a bad dream. Noma is akin to an amusement park ride that's past its prime. His food and the preparation of it is cliched. <br/><br/>Steve Martin pegged it perfectly in ""L.A. Story."" Find it, watch it, and recognize that Noma was passe even before it was Noma. "
5197,Styles,"Dana -- thank you for the informative article.  As a citizen of Bangladesh, I will let Shile Begum and her fellow women know that they should really go back to the suburbs and spend time attending PTO meetings and Bake Sales, instead of working in these horrible garment factories.  "
5198,Styles,"A interesting article is over at Project Syndicate. It is Kaushik Basu's ""Why is Bangladesh Booming?"" <a href=""https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/bangladesh-sources-of-economic-growth-by-kaushik-basu-2018-04/english"" title=""https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/bangladesh-sources-of-economic-growth-by-kaushik-basu-2018-04/english"" target=""_blank"">https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/bangladesh-sources-of-econo...</a><br/><br/>An extract: ""To what does Bangladesh owe its quiet transformation? ... [I]n my view, Bangladeshâs economic transformation was driven in large part by social changes, starting with the empowerment of women.... Bangladesh has made significant strides toward educating girls and giving women a greater voice, both in the household and the public sphere. These efforts have translated into improvements in childrenâs health and education, such that Bangladeshisâ average life expectancy is now 72 years, compared to 68 years for Indians and 66 years for Pakistanis.... Another partial explanation for Bangladeshâs progress is the success of its garment manufacturing industry."""
5199,Climate,"Air you can't breath!<br/>Water you can't drink or swim in!<br/><br/>Let the people choke and sicken as long as corporations can line their pockets, even more!"
5200,Climate,This is part of the very successful  implementation of the the Trump policies that gives Pruitt free reign. Nauseating.
5201,Climate,"The fact that they used the words type of science indicates how vastly and grossly unqualified they are to run the EPA. There arenât types of science. There is science. Period. Science is a method of investigation  that makes use of rigorous standards to ensure quality of results. What they should have said is that they are not interested in using science to make policy, they are interested in whatever the Koch brothers tell them to do to make policy. How do we dig ourselves back out of this? How do we convince that segment of the population that is so enthralled  with our sociopath-in-chief that they will overlook literally anything in the service of making sure that he can do as much damage to our country as humanly possible just so long as he continues to toot his dog whistle to them ?"
5202,Climate,Iâm not shocked. Why not just rename it the Environmental Degradation Agency? 
5203,Climate,"The article counters Pruitt's proposals as violating current laws and regulations, which could and should be contested in court.<br/><br/>Further, Pruitt's actions don't surprise me, in that this thug has flaunted every impropriety possible, for his personal benefit. <br/><br/>Pruitt's actions should be investigated by the appropriate US Attorney's Office in order to ascertain whether he has committed any criminal acts, and not merely non-criminal ethics violations."
5204,Climate,"The next coal ash levy that lets go, Pruitt's head should be held in the out flow. It will be his and his bosses, MR. Trump, responsibly."
5205,Climate,"I'm not sure what people are worried about - this rule fosters greater transparency and thus great scientific validity.  <br/><br/>NSF, NIH, DOE, NOAA, and now it looks like EPA grants will be joining the list, have been under strictures to make the underlying data available at the conclusion of a study.<br/><br/>Most research universities across the country have been enfranchising Research Data Repository programs to satisfy these burgeoning grant requirements.  <br/><br/>The logic being that if the research is paid for by the public, then the underlying data needs to be made available.  This doesn't mean people's identities who participated in the studies with the promise of confidentiality will have their identities exposed or that such studies with confidentiality as to the identities of participants would be prevented from being used for rule-making.<br/><br/>What it will do is prevent studies without the underlying data being presented from being used.  Currently, a series of EPA rules limiting particulates only have the ""results interpreted by the authors"" published with the underlying data hidden - release of the underlying data does not imply or require the release of the identities of the subjects in the studies.<br/><br/>The EPA seems to be years behind the rest of the major granting agencies in adopting such rules.  That they now require that such studies that are to be used in rule-making follow the new guidelines is very reasonable.  <br/><br/>Pruitt's rule makes good scientific sense."
5206,Climate,Since when did these people care about the public?
5207,Climate,"Richard J. Lazarus, a professor of environmental law at Harvard, said Mr. Pruitt would be âwalking into a judicial minefieldâ if he told the E.P.A. to no longer consider certain studies during agency rule-making.<br/><br/>That, Mr. Lazarus said, would be considered an arbitrary and capricious decision under the Administrative Procedure Act, which governs agency rule-making, and would âsubject any agency regulation issued based on such a defective record to ready judicial invalidation.â<br/><br/>Within these sentences is the real problem this country faces because Trump and the GOP are currently filling the courts with biased judges who are unlikely to find any (conservative) regulation as arbitrary and capricious; out of deference to the executive branch, of course.   Thus, if the executive branch wants to rewrite the rules for what types of science are acceptable in rule making, so be it, even if the intent of the rules is to block most science from being considered.  The Luddites have gained control folks and will wreak as much havoc as possible until removed.  "
5208,Climate,"The pressure on scientists to produce results and publish articles, coupled with the competition for grants for research, makes for sloppy documentation and often also for slovenly research and science.<br/>Science is probably not to be blamed."
5209,Climate,Go to the Bronx River near where you live and take a gulp. Thatâs what Pruitt wants your drinking water to be. 
5210,Climate,Oh please itâs quite simple to deitentify study subjects and make the data public.  This is a solid move thatâs replacing the Obama administrationâs advocacy with sound science.  
5211,Sports,"Why even have cheerleaders, they are not part of televised games and only a few fans are close enough to see them. Beyond this I don't get why anyone would want to be a cheerleader. Let alone for poverty pay."
5212,Sports,"An easier solution for the women who do not not agree with the terms of being an NFL cheerleader would be to not accept the unfavorable terms and seek employment elsewhere. Avoid the alleged discrimination and don't take the position at all. Problem solved. Usually can't have cake and eat it as well.<br/><br/>Secondarily, they could also use the position as is, to gain whatever exposure they are seeking and leave when it's convenient on their own terms. But please, stop the whining.....if you're among the 53% white women who voted for Trump, you should know he would support the NFL, not you."
5213,Sports,"NFL cheerleaders are underpaid, discriminated against and apparently otherwise treated horribly. And if the NFL eliminates all of cheerleading squads, the same women will sue them. Thatâs a lot of chutzpah."
5214,Sports,Highly profitable and powerful companies taking advantage of workers is a widespread  problem and at the root of many ills
5215,Sports,Since you asked: the NFL would never be a signatory to an AFL/CIO associated union like Equity.  And there are too many women willing to work as non-union cheerleaders.
5216,Washington,Youâve got to be kidding. What gives the âChristianâ Right the idea that they can take over our government for their Kingdom agenda.
5217,Washington,There is a religious left???  I thought most of them thought the entity does not exist and those who believe are mentally defective.
5218,Washington,Agree with your analysis. On the basis that the Evangelicals have eliminated the separation of church and state they should now be obliged to pay all taxes including back taxes for the period involved.

5226,Weekend,Do you still live in Marvel's universe if you think those movies are stupid light shows for dumb people to spend their money on?
5227,Weekend,Reading this review was almost as fun as watching Marvel films.<br/><br/>I love my low-brow-schlock and no studio does it better than Marvel. 
5228,Weekend,"There are some great thought nuggets in this piece, but yikes, it's so weirdly dismissive and pretentious. The section about the taboo against spoilers could be removed if Scott just put a ""Spoilers: All"" tag at the top. And while I appreciate the recognition that Infinity War isn't a stand-alone movie but ""a chunk of matter in the Marvel Universe,"" a review on Infinity War doesn't need to be a critique on the MCU or the superhero genre as a whole. Those are valuable insights, but warrant their own piece. This article doesn't really get into the review until the final two grafs â again, lots of interesting commentary, but not exactly the right stage and certainly too snarky."
5229,Weekend,"My dad was a big Star Wars/ Indiana Jones fan, so my childhood was filled with supernatural movies and Iâve been a big fan of fantasy ever since. What Disney/Marvel has done with this franchise is truly incredible. Theyâve continued to work with some of the biggest names in Hollywood while still keeping the films relevant for decades. There is a joy that these films bring me that the real world cannot always give. At the end of every Marvel movie, viewers leave feeling excited, hopeful, and maybe even a little more inclined to do the right thing (Although I did not leave this movie feeling hopeful). Marvel has learned how to lean into the corniness of its characters in order for viewers to accept these movies for what they are and thoroughly enjoy them.<br/><br/>The great thing about this film was that they stayed true to the characters I have come to fall in love with. Each heroeâs personality shone threw so much that you got to have a good laugh while you rooted for each one both individually and collectively. Marvelâs mistake was that, while for years weâve seen Thanos and know heâs coming, we donât know enough about Thanos to truly understand his motive. Iâm interested to see how they pick up the next movie. Iâm sure it will be creative, maybe even a little corny, but I know that Iâll still have a great time watching it."
5230,Weekend,"At 2 hours and 40 minutes, not including 20 minutes of trailers and 15 minutes of pre-tailer commercials, I will wait until I can watch from the comfort of home with a pause button and proximity to the bathroom."
5231,Weekend,"Ho hum.  How boring is this type of film that has to rely on CGI to generate any kind of thrill?<br/><br/>I outgrew cartoons when I passed the age of 10.  It's a sad commentary that films like this have an audience that considers them to be great entertainment.<br/><br/>I'll pass, thank you."
5232,Weekend,"Mr. Scott seems to have forgotten that this is a COMIC BOOK movie.  Instead of trying to apply some twisted, high brow, philosophical logic he would be better off debating if Captain America is stronger than Spider Man.  The word verbose does not even do it justice.  If it is pointless to complain (which it is), why does he then proceed to do exactly that, in spades?  Why would a reviewer ever possibly wonder why the plot is kept top secret and he shouldn't reveal details?  Mr. Scott, that's why it's called a 'spoiler'.  Yes, I am a fan and enjoyed the film, but I have never felt so irked or annoyed by a !@#* movie review!  And did he really imply that Marvel 'shrewdly' crafted this to be a statement on our society?  Now I am laughing. "
5233,Weekend,Movies should be fun and this one achieves and excels. Critics have a  job to do and it is unfortunate many are disconnected from the tastes of film audiences. People go to the moves to escape the drama of daily life. This movie was fun and entertaining and I was happy to spend money to see it.
5234,Weekend,"I found the first hour very entertaining, mainly because of the great humor in the Guardians of the Galaxy scenes. Why couldn't their second movie have been written like that? The action and urgency kept my attention, too, keeping me from noticing the lack of a main character arc -- or any character's arc, really. But then came the rest of the movie, and it just got really slow and sagged. Then I started getting major Marvel fatigue. There were some bright spots along the way, but the rest of the movie was pretty dull, and here I really noticed the lack of any character arc to give some emotional substance to all the explosions."
5235,Weekend,"Waiting for the first fanboy to weigh in and explain how we all just don't get it, or how silly we are that we didn't catch the Jungian metaphors of Thanos or the classic Marvelian mythologies of blah blah blah...<br/>I quite like some of the Marvel output so far. But listening to the fawning, uncritical fans is like listening to a college freshman blather about Kant halfway through his 101 course...you know they don't know jack, but they'll happily talk your ear off, anyway. "
5236,Weekend,"It was very good, but not necessarily the best. It was much darker and ending had an unexpected twist. If anything, it was like going to a Chinese Buffet, where one is overwhelmed with the sheer variety and volume of food. There is a lot going on in this movie, but the 2 hours and 40 minutes go by pretty fast."
5237,Weekend,I saw Infinity war last night and found it immensely enjoyable. I'm a fan of the franchise and this film will be debated in the nerd kingdom for the next year. One thing you know when you follow Marvel or DC is superheroes never die. Looking forward to Avengers 4 next May. 
5238,Weekend,"I agree with you A.O. Scott. I saw this movie last night, and while it's not a perfect movie by any means, it is a darn good time and one of the better installments in the Marvel Universe. <br/><br/>But I agree with you in the fact that there is no use in voicing complaints. They have a formula, they nail it here. Who doesn't love giant action sequences, rooting for your favorite hero? (Mine happens to be Hawkeye, so no cheering for me in this one.)<br/><br/>Everyone has something to root for, take what it is at face value, applaud them for pulling off a feat as large as this as well as they did, and simply enjoy it. There's no use in arguing."
5239,Weekend,"Have to agree with you and also with the reviewer. <br/><br/>We didn't walk out but after an hour, the movie had run out, just went downhill from there, unlike Black Panther."
5240,Weekend,Infinity War movie was insipid.  How's that for succinct?
5241,Weekend,Fun?  That was the furthest thing from my mind as I sat through an hour's worth of a movie that made me feel acutely that I was wasting precious time.  I consider myself lucky for having walked out early.
5242,Weekend,"We saw the movie tonight and A.O. Scott nailed this review.<br/><br/>""So cool and above it all""?  You're mistaking him with Dargis."
5243,Metro,"Several years ago, after traveling to U.S. cities where they do offer residential parking permits, I inquired to a city agency (I don't remember which) why residential parking permits weren't offered in my UWS neighborhood.  I was told ""there's no demand.""  Hmmmm.  Today, I guess there is no demand for consistent subway system service either.  God knows what routes will be in effect on the weekends.  New York can do better for its residents."
5244,Metro,"I think anyone should be able to park on the street, however, non-New York residents should pay for the privilege.  Similar to the way cashless tools automatically register and bill drivers without EZ-Pass, DOT personnel would scan license plate info from non-NY plates.  The bills would be automatically sent to the owners and if the account is not kept current, the vehicle tire would get booted next time in town - just like what happens when folks neglect to pay parking tickets.  I suspect if the cost of daily street parking equaled or exceeded  parking garage rates, folks who are using the uptown city streets as their commuting garage and then taking the subway downtown might soon opt for the convenience and cost reduction of parking in a garage close to where they work; or better yet, maybe they would start using mass transit.  Downside of course is the cost associated with employing extra DOT personnel to walk the neighborhoods and scanning the license plates."
5245,Metro,move to Washington Heights or earn enough to use a parking lot. 
5246,Foreign,"To anyone saying that they are undermining our laws, people are allowed to come to the U.S. to apply for asylum. It seems to me that these people don't want immigrants to follow our immigration laws as much as they want none of them in the U.S. "
5247,Foreign,"If these people are truly fleeing persecution and violence then some should be happy to apply for asylum and stay in Mexico.  Its kind of like those migrants who go to Calais, saying they need asylum, but that it needs to be in the UK and not any of the numerous European countries they have just passed through"
5248,Washington,"The French are far too sophisticated to believe in Trump. Macron - correctly - is playing a diplomatic game that matches his needs and those of his country. If Macron - facing pressure at home - can be seen in Europe as the ""Dog Whisperer"" who can modify Trump's behavior, it dramatically increases his power in France and in the EU. This 'close friendship' suits both men for now but make no mistake, Macron will be the first to disinfect himself from Trump's irrevocable stain the moment this arrangement interferes with his own goals. "
5249,Foreign,"Certainly, it must be possible to amend the law to account for such cases as Renford McIntyre, and to grant him official citizenship, or else reinstate permanent residency status, and return to him his benefits, but otherwise enforce immigration controls for true illegals, and to actually repatriate true illegals. <br/><br/>This is an unintended outcome, which can be rectified, but it should not be used to oppose immigration controls for newer arrivals, who have come on mass."

5253,National,I cant believe this. DACA was an executive order that Obama started using just his power as president. That power is supposed to be weak and yet now this judge says DACA has the same force as a law passed by Congress would have?! <br/><br/>I'm really surprised by this outcome. Do executive orders now have the force of Congressional Law? Is it just that Obama executive orders have the force of law? What happened here?!

In fact, we see some kind of outrageous behvior on the part of ICE in the news every week.<br/><br/>Does anyone know if ICE has an Inspector General watching them?  I applaud the judge's decision, but I question whether ICE will change their behavior toward those people who have grown up here, been educated here and know no pother country.<br/><br/>ICE has terrorized many people across the country for spite and yes, acted like Trump himself, capricious arbitrary and cruel.  Racists must never run our immigration naturalization system."
5255,National,It wonât be heard by SCOTUS now that three federal courts agree that the administration is in the wrong.
5256,National,Will: this is not the fault of DACA children.  You want something real to blame: blame big companies for sending jobs overseas where there are lax environmental laws and labor that gets paid $1 an hour.  The parents of these children come here to find a better life.
5257,National,"Perhaps you should read the Constitution, Everett. The President has the right to  manage operations of the federal government via executive order carrying the weight of law including prosecutorial discretion.

5260,Politics,"Itâs funny. Come November, Conor Lamb wonât even have a district to run in. His win against a wan Republican candidate in PA was moot. <br/><br/>And yet his race, in a now defunct district as reliably and historically red as this one in AZ, will have garnered probably 20 times the media attention that this race just did and will. Apparently, there are few tea leaves to be read here. But there were crates and crates to be had out of the races that have gone well for the Democrats, in easy environments like VA and NJ, and against an amazingly awful GOP candidate like the child molester in AL. <br/><br/>Conclusion? The media has an agenda and a narrative. Stories that donât serve it, donât get told as much. Similarly, this blue wave business is seriously overhyped. I went through it in GAâs 6th. Seeing all of those woke suburbanites knocking on doors, thinking they were going to elect a Democrat, was one of the sadder things Iâve seen this year. <br/><br/>My hope is that after the blue wave is revealed to be a ripple, that progressives donât go off and do something dumb or tragic like hurting themselves. That gentleman who self immolated in Central Park earlier this month was truly tragic, and I genuinely fear for other progressivesâ mental well being. Thereâs more to life than politics. Set the bar low, and donât count on a great November. "
5261,Politics,"Given the Right Wing Supreme Court and the continuing influence of White Supremacy, I'm not sure the country can be saved, regardless of Congressional elections. Trump and the GOP have pushed the country back to 1950, if not earlier. "
5262,Politics,I live here and saw plenty of Leskoâs ads. Sheâs as vile as you most likely expect she is. 
5263,Politics,"The season of mean is still in for the United States! This Arizona election is not an anomaly either! And in an adjacent article comparing our present time to the 1980âs is off the mark! There are few similar cultural comparisons ! And there were no Shark Tanks, just as Ronald Reagan, G-d rest his soul, was essentially a benevolent statesman, not a paper thin bully and gutter embracer, like Donald Trump!"
5264,Politics,Congratulations Ms. Lesko!
5265,Politics,This Congressional seat will be re-fought in November. So if the Republican Congress continues to support Trump and his disastrous agenda for the next 6 months it is possible that Ms Lesko will be a 6 month Congresswoman. Trump is bad for Republicans and worse for the entire country. We've still got 6 months to turn back the Red Tide and truly make America Great Again. Surely even the most deplorable of Trump's base will see how bad his behavior and actions as POTUS have been for them as well as for all the rest of us.
5266,Politics,"To the people of Arizona:  Sorry but the people of New York have IRRECONCILABLE differences with you because anyone who could still, after all we've endured, vote for someone who bases their candidacy on support of Trump cannot be part of the same country as us.  The same goes for Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, Tennessee, Oklahoma, Kentucky...get the idea?  See, we're attempting to convince ourselves that the mid-term elections will start to set things right but what if it does not?  What's the next step?  Is it so far-fetched to begin to think about DIVORCE?    Maybe the British will take us back?  I mean who would you rather have as your head of state, Trump or Elizabeth 2?  I rest my case. "
5267,Politics,"Democrats are still living the dream if Republicans have to spend this much effort on every ""safe"" district.  And a +12-14% shift during a relatively quiet news cycle means a likely House flip this fall, and possibly more if a few headline-news events hit."
5268,Politics,"The district has a large number of uneducated white voters, or perhaps more commonly known as ""bigots.""  The fact that the challenger did so well in a predominantly racist district does not look good for Republicans."
5269,Politics,"Democrats refuse to learn from their mistakes or successes.<br/>They keep bringing up 1968.<br/>Hello! The world had changed since 1968. <br/><br/>Every election is an opportunity to convince the voters that the left is the future, but the Democrats refuse to lead. They just let the Republicans win.<br/>A Democrat that refuses to oppose Republican policy is not worth electing.<br/><br/>All that is necessary for emperor Wannabes like Trump to get elected is for Democrats to do nothing, and that is what Democrats keep doing.<br/>We keep hearing how centrists, ""get things done,"" but the only thing they get done is voting for Republican policy. They run on opposing the principles of their own party. <br/><br/>In NY State we have Democrats caucusing with the Republicans. We don't need Democrats that are actually Republicans in sheep clothing.  <br/><br/>Go into the red districts and promise to help the working poor and their families, who are almost everyone in the states. They have been taught that greed is good. Tell then it's their turn to be greedy, tax the rich, and get some of the benefits of their labor. "
5270,Politics,"The Trump base is about a third of the population. His support with them is resilient.  It is the people that voted, not for Trump, but against Hillary, that are not tied to him.<br/>But stop assuming that they are looking for an establishment centrist. They voted against all of the establishment centrists. They are looking for someone that can solve their very real economic problems, something which both Republicans (who say that tax cuts for the rich are the answer) and centrist Democrats (who just want to compromise with Republicans) refuse to do.<br/>Republicans are going to call you tax and spend socialists no matter how many cuts to taxes and spending you make. Instead, own it. ""Yes, we will tax the crony capitalists to invest in you and your children. Republicans borrow and slash taxes on the rich. We can pay the debt and pay for education, healthcare, and infrastructure, and put money in your pockets that will actually grow the economy.""<br/>That is how you win, not by refusing to promise anything while Republicans promise all things to all people. <br/><br/>Promise that you will help them get ahead, and yet will give you a chance.<br/>The unpopularity of Trump is s huge opportunity to change the status quo.<br/>Take it.

5272,Politics,"Just as in VA, the major energy  in November will come from the new activists in the Indivisible groups,  March for Our Lives, Black Lives Matter, MeToo, the WOmen's March, etc.  If Ryan gets his Medicare and Social Security cuts passed, I expect there will be a group of Gray Panthers, too. The DNC doesn't seem to want to acknowledge the existence of these groups, but they are the blue wave and they will take back the House in November. "
5273,Politics,"Not so. No one can afford to be without Medicare. If youâre eligible, your private insurance will refuse to cover you. Therefore, Medicare is essential to everyone over sixty-five.

5277,Sports,"A solution to one and done, not dependent on the NBA:<br/><br/>A scholarship is given for four years, with the same limited number that a team is currently allowed. If a player leaves before the four years are up, that player's scholarship still counts toward that total, and goes unused for the remainder of those four years."
5278,Sports,"This commission and the NCAA start with a bogus premise: excluding the cost of their education - something for which they work dozens of hours a week via practice, games, travel, conditioning, etc. - the players should not benefit finaicially from the revenue they generate. Meanwhile college basketball has so much money in it now that head coaches are often the top paid public employee (or 2nd most paid, after the head football coach at State U), athletic directors make well over $1m a year, assistant coaches make upwards of $1m at elite unis, etc. A huge percentage of that revenue should go to the players, full stop. Without their labor, there is simply no major college basketball, and today, outside of the cost of education, they receive ZERO compensation - AND are prohibited from holding down outside jobs, etc. It's shocking exploitation."
5279,Sports,"Notice no penalties proposed related to academic performance, because the main goal of the NCAA is to preserve a system where the (largely white) administrators, coaches, assistant coaches, trainers, referees, TV and radio announcers, media personnel (including the writer of this story and the employees of this newspaper) all get paid, in some cases millions of dollars, off the backs of the (largely African American) players, who for the most part don't even get a degree.  These proposals are designed to keep the talent flowing at the cheapest possible price to the colleges.  It's the last plantation in America."
5280,Sports,"This is a ridiculous statement from the article: âThe corruption we observed in college basketball has its roots in youth basketball,â Rice said. The truth is that youth basketball has been corrupted by the corrupt college basketball culture/system."

5286,Learning,"Truth be told, my parents who I love dearly are somewhat paradoxical characters. The younger I was, the more freedom I had when it came to my future. Dentist one day, president of the United States the next. I hate to call it a 'phase' because it only accredits my parents more but sure, I'll give it to them this time. Despite my diabolical and somewhat ourageous aspirations considering their insurmountable odds, my parents went along with it. Perhaps, even encouraged it. However, upon my graceful induction into what I then called, 'twelve-teen', their unhinged enthusiasm saw an unexpected pullback. And man did I notice. Nowadays, just a year away from college, from the sidelines they lovingly attempt to micromanage all aspects of my life and steer me away from the inevitable horrors which await me. How do we engage in  these deep, analytical, thought-provoking conservations about my future? For now, there is nothing a good movie can't fix.                                   "
5287,Learning,"	For as long as I can remember, I have loved plans. I like knowing definitively what Iâm going to do, when Iâm going to do it, and where. The plans changed as I grew up - when I was eleven, I wanted to be a veterinarian, and then I realized Iâd have to know everything about every animal. When I was fifteen, I wanted to be a barn manager, and then I realized Iâd make next to nothing. Now, Iâm seventeen, and I want to be an OT and live in New York City. Thatâll probably change, as plans always do. But for now, Iâm happy.<br/><br/>	My mom was the one who pointed out the holes in my plans. Pointed out salaries and the things an average eleven or thirteen-year-old will forget. Pointed out the sharp edge of reality when my head was in the clouds. My mom taught me compassion and empathy, and I took those lessons and ran with them, and now I hope my life revolves around those things. She is hardly ever confused or angry about decisions I make - it was hard for me to relate to kids who panicked over flunking tests because their parents would âkill themâ."

5289,Magazine,"In the Uber case, I completely disagree.  The driver is far removed from the ethical responsibility here on any ticket issued. That the responsibility was the passenger's who brow-beat the immigrant driver to stop is a given.    That the address remember was inputted by the passenger is also a given.  That is why I also would hold Uber and Google responsible.   It used to be that a taxi driver knew the city, but an Uber driver only has to follow his map.   The map was wrong.   So they have responsibility here as well.    I recently left New York for the Catskills and ended up in Secaucus and assumed I must have done something wrong in following the directions to get onto the New Jersey Turnpike.   A night later I was in a bar in the Catskills and got to talking and it turned out somebody that day had the exact same situation.   The driver may not have known where he was going but that is tough luck for the passenger who made his choice, and, ahum, sometimes the fates are against you. Here the passenger brags about his wealth.  Well Sir, it doesn't buy you out of being civil to the 'help.'  "

5297,Arts&Leisure,"Went to see âLight Shining in Buckinghamshireâ in previews last week. Knowing something of the history of the time enhances the experience. Even without doing that homework, it's a memorable experience. Caryl Churchill is served well by this cast and brilliant production. "
5298,Arts&Leisure,"I DID see ""Top Girls"" in London in 1983, it was extraordinary. I was there for a semester abroad (I was a Theatre Major) and my 5 roommates and I all saw it together (we were all in the same program). We then performed part of it in an acting class as a final project. And THEN, in 2015, all 6 of us got together in London,  sat in our living room one night with scripts and read the whole thing through again, each of us playing the same roles. It's a marvelous play."
5299,Arts&Leisure,"I adore Ms. Churchill's work, as well as that of Mr. Stoppard, but I disagree with the author's first statement that they are Englands greatest living playwrights.  I would put the much more prolific, entertaining and enlightening Sir Alan Ayckbourn before either of them."

Like Trump, he has enough skeletons in his closet (and not well-hidden at that) to meet the calcium needs of the citizens of an American metropolis for weeks, if not months. If he insists on running for US Senator, his opponents, and the citizens of West Virginia, need to remind themselves and the voters that Mr. Blankenship is an unapologetic and unrepentant con man who doesn't deserve the honor of representing any US citizens in the Senate.

If brain-addled coal miners in West Virginia think it's in their best interests to vote for a guy who has grossly enriched himself directly at the expense of their lives, then they get what they deserve.<br/><br/>Why didn't the courts lock Blankenship up and throw away the key?  He is Exhibit A when it comes to rapacious capitalism, as well as for the need for the tightest possible federal and state regulations on extraction industries.<br/><br/>A more loathsome Republican candidate would be hard to imagine . . . oops, I've already forgotten the despicable Roy Moore -- not to mention our embarrassing excuse for a ""president."""
5308,Politics,"Well, I have been saying that we are working hard to make ourselves into China - Chinese social security is a law that makes letting your parents starve illegal; how Ryan would love that - so Don Blankenship coming out and praising the type of robber baron capitalism in China is refreshing. At last, someone has put the reality right out there in front of us. <br/><br/>Because Blankenship would fit in, if only he joined the Party. While well connected but less than moral businessmen were selling tainted baby formula, and building giant trash piles from construction that collapse and destroy the community nearby, Blankenship ran a company that poisons water while ignoring the safety violations that could have kept 29 men alive. Of course in China, if the unfettered greed makes for bad press, Blankenship could face the death penalty over there. You have to be a very careful, very well connected robber baron.<br/><br/>The GOP keeps chasing policy that makes us look back at Teddy Roosevelt wistfully.

5313,Washington,"Everyone keeps hoping that the  Supremes will uphold the constitution and be the bulwark against tyranny and extremism.   When has the court done that in the past?   For a short period in the 1950's and 1960's, they were for the bill of rights and the little guy or defendants in criminal cases.   Otherwise they have pretty much always been pro wealth and pro statist.  What did they do for the Japanese who were interned during World War II.   Did they stick up for the constitutional rights of the Japanese/Americans  -- most of whom were actually U. S. citizens?   No.<br/><br/>The justices use a lot of gobble de gook such as originalism, textualism, strict construction, etc. to pretend that they follow sincerely held legal principles and to obscure what they do.   But often their decisions can be easily predicted ahead of time.    <br/><br/>If an individual sues a corporation -- the republican members of the court will rule against the individual regardless of law, the facts of the case, etc.<br/><br/>If an individual sues the federal government in a case relating to foreign policy/defense -- the individual will lose.   Again regardless of the facts of the situation or how egregious the actions of the government,  the republican justices will uphold the government.     All the government has to do is say that it relates to ""national security.""   "

My grandfather, who farmed outside of Abbeville, was a member of the KKK and I believe (though I don't know for sure) that he probably participated in the lynching. My mother left the South and she and my father raised me to believe that all people have value and that discrimination on the basis of skin color is wrong. I applaud the Equal Justice Initiative. Its work and this National Memorial for Peace and Justice is long overdue. "

5319,National,"Humanityâs capacity for evil and atrocity will never cease to stun and terrify me. From the dawn of time, those with greater capacity for atrocity and depravity against other human beings, they are the ones who got the wealth and power. How did kings become kings? Why them and not someone else? Why did one group prosper and get all the land, while the other was destroyed? The winners had the greater capacity for cruelty and evil. Every day I read of a story where this is happening in modern times. The weaker, the poorer, the more peaceful being brutalized, tortured, murdered by the stronger in the name of something. The 8 year old girl gang raped repeatedly over a 4 day period in India, by government officials and police officers. Then strangled. This happened to a small child just recently. The 6 million Jews starved, tortured, burned in ovens. My own ancestors beheaded. I can list thousands of other examples. I cannot fathom a life of slavery, a life where I am owned and whipped and forced to do back-breaking labor simply because I look different. Treated in a manner most of us wouldnât treat an animal. Thinking about it at this moment, I would prefer death. I think these memorials are important because they remind us of humanityâs capacity for evil and depravity. It is unfathomable to me that people in my countryâs history were able to do this to other human beings. But the fact is they did and we must never forget that."

5339,Well,"Excessive fees for commonsense advice for Type 2 diabetes go right along with the excessive fees for the newish diabetes drugs like Toujeo (those bouncy diabetics in television ads), Trulicity, and Jardiance. Even with a top Medicare Part D plan, the deductible for these medicines can be as much as $300/month (for just one of them). Part 2 diabetes may drive up healthcare costs, but it also provides a steady revenue stream for insurers. If diabetes were actually cured or prevented for most people, I think it would cause more pain than relief for our healthcare system. "
5340,Well,"""Hospitals can charge what they like for their services.""<br/><br/>I learned this one the hard way. My doctor's office was not drawing blood. So he sent me downstairs to the office in the lobby, which is run by the hospital owning the building. They sent the blood to Quest for allergy testing. The hospital then billed my insurance $4,878. I was astounded.  I checked with Quest. She quoted some numbers for some of the tests. Calculating it out implied the total invoice charge was under $400. I walked into the hospital's billing department. I spoke with the woman that processed the bill. The hospital had not yet received the Quest invoice. But she told me they can charge whatever they want.<br/><br/>My insurer has a deal with the hospital where they accept 75% of what the hospital charges. And then they paid 80% of that, with my responsibility being the other 20%. Hence they paid $2,889 and I was left owing $792 for the co-insurance (including the NY State surcharge).<br/><br/>At the time my tenant worked in the diabetes department at the hospital. I told her the story. She was well aware of the issue. They don't send their patients to the hospital for blood draws, but have them go directly to the Quest office, which is only a few blocks away.<br/><br/>I told the hospital that if they continued to pursue me for the $792 I would complain to NY state. They never responded to me, but the bills asking me to pay stopped. <br/><br/>I now always go directly to the Quest lab."

It does not need the categorically incorrect equation with the Holocaust made by several of the Most Recommended comments. The Holocaust (as such) was not an effort to take their land, put them in ""their place"", terrorize, or enslave them but, rather, the industrialized attempt to expunge Jews and Roma from the face of the earth."
5373,Editorial,"Hopefully, this Museum represents a new pulse in the continued need to lay open, make changes, alter and eventually transform American society into a more inclusive, equal and united people who are defined for their countries ideals, constitutional seachange and the potentials they aspire to and to be lived and lived up to.<br/><br/>There is much that needs to be done and many things that must happen but most importantly, most Americans must be remade from within to change reality as it now is without in the broad daylight that honest clarity and bothered knowledge cannot deny.<br/><br/>Until it is accepted that the Heart of Darkness in so many which led to so much harm and hurt and also lay in even more who let these things happen , turned a blind eye or let justice lapse and time forget...still beats today (though in more subtle ways) no change can come soon enough and no society can reach or attain the fruition that marks the long and winding steps that follows the only path that must be taken and which leads to success. <br/><br/>That day is yet to come, but another tool and test has arrived to help guide the way forward. For this one and those others we increasingly are made aware of and need to fix, change and address...the path to take and the choice to make is clearer than ever.<br/><br/>Whilst the solution remains the same as it always has been and what has always been needed to be solved...is but the action that needs to be taken by those that should...most of them...you, me, us.<br/><br/>So take it."
5374,National,One can only imagine what this Police Officer did in his time as a Soldier in Vietnam .
5375,National,"I don't understand your lead sentence. ""...long before the term was commonly used."" What term? Rape? Murder? Terror? California?"
5376,National,"Is there a case for a DNA swab to be taken for everyone and babies from birth? A DNA match with a crime does not prove guilt but in many cases, will move each case along."
5377,National,"Thank you to the deceased author who've did all the hard work.<br/>Law Enforcement did not find a ""needle in haystack"".<br/>Quite the opposite, they let one of their own, with a badge, walk away under extremely suspicious circumstances,<br/>so the ex-cop could rape and kill dozens more for many years, until a brave and determined civilian refused to drop the case."
5378,National,"Thank science for DNA technology that allows the discovery and uncovering of such heinous and despicable crimes that though comes so many decades after, is never too late. Thank the the investigators too for their persistence, and the victims who had the courage to share any information on this terrible person - no punishment can be too severe or so long."
5379,National,"If everyone's DNA were collected at birth, such crimes would become almost impossible in a generation.  If everyone's DNA were collected on their next visit to a doctor, such crimes would become impossible and many old ones would be solved.  We could make getting away with these crimes almost impossible, but we dont want to.    <br/><br/>Our right to privacy is routinely violated on the Internet, where inquiring about any product brings scads of ads for similar products.  But giving a DNA sample gives people the willies.  This response does not seem rational except for those who are entertaining the idea of committing crimes or parenting children without having to take responsibility for them.  "
5380,National,I have a hard time believing that he stopped committing these crimes back in the 1980s.  I wonder if they will turn up evidence that he traveled to other states  since then.
5381,National,Awful.  but I want to know more.. about the why.  The guy was between 31 and 41 while he was commiting these crimes.  What was the rest of his life? (and how did that help him elude capture?)  Did anybody know?  Did anybody suspect?  I hope that there may be some answers -- altho I don't know if they will have value in preventing such incidents in the future.
5382,National,"It wasnât on file, they probably got it out of his trash or when he discarded some object while under surveillance- hence âabandoned DNAâ . "
5383,National,"Actually, Occam's razor suggests that someone turned this guy in for the 50 grand reward.  Police work whether persistent or not had very little to do with this guy finally getting hauled in...I'm betting based on Occam's razor."
5384,National,He likely followed police directives and didn't pull a gun or try to attack them and flee.
5385,National,How about if each and every police employee in all the USA and its territories provide fingerprints and DNA samples as a condition of employment?  Why was this manâs info not matched up sooner?
5386,National,I didnât read her book but Iâm guessing you didnât either. And data mining doesnât work if the data isnât there.
5387,National,Seems in this case a police officer WAS the worst of humanity. 
5388,Sports,"I love how the owners completely stone-walled the players and the ""real"" issue of racial disgrimination yet still called the meeting a ""success."" The arrogance of the white rich is simply stupifying!"
5389,Sports,"Honestly, I don't believe a football game is the correct venue for a protest. The football players are not in charge and in my opinion, must follow the rules. If they are uncomfortable, they are free to leave and protest elsewhere. It amazes me that these NFL players do not seem to understand that they are all replaceable, and merely an injury away from potentially ending their careers. I do not need their protests to remind me of injustices, or to inspire me to be socially active.<br/>Also wondering why Colin Kaepernick is held in such high esteem when his career was clearly declining at the conclusion of his tenure. If I owned an NFL team, I wouldn't hire him either. Don't the NFL owners have the right to hire whom they wish? The protests have a price. I always thought Colin used the protests to distract from his mediocre performance."
5390,Sports,What if the players were taking a knee for a different cause... say pro-life or better health care of our veterans?  Would anyone claim to be offended or enraged with this because it disrespects our soldiers who served to defend our flag and country?  To conflate speaking up against racial injustice with disrespecting our military shows a double standard for free speech and belies a lack of support for a founding (and changing) principle of our country: equality.
5391,Sports,The players are about their rights and social justice. The owners are all about the  money and PR.
5392,Sports,"I applaud players and owners who kneel for the anthem. It's the most respectful action imaginable and honors every man and woman who have served our country. How can anybody pretend that blacks in this country have been treated with fairness?  Slavery. Jim Crow. Redlining. Mass incarceration. If you don't agree with the kneel, then put your patriotism where your insults are and protest and eradicate racism in your town. Fire officers who discriminate. Otherwise, you're a hypocrite and (I hate to have to put it this way) a bigot."
5393,Sports,"It's interesting how misinformed readers are. Mr. Kaepernick first sat during the National Anthem as a protest and was approached by a white veteran who suggested that kneeling was a more respectful gesture. This is always lost in the overall narrative. The consensus is that Mr. Kaepernick is deliberately being disrespectful by kneeling. This is wrong. <br/><br/>African Americans live with the fear of losing their lives in any encounter with the police. One of my top employees habitually is stopped for driving while black here in New York City. <br/><br/>He saved to purchase a 'nice car' and is frequently stopped for no reason. He has a well maintained vehicle and has a clean driving record. <br/><br/>A friend (African American) was a former member of the LAPD. He drove a Mustang GT and he was was frequently stopped by the LAPD for DWB. He had his weapon, shield, police ID, license and registration sitting on his lap when approached by the patrolling officer. The cop looked at the ID, shrugged sheepishly and returned to the police cruiser letting my friend leave. <br/><br/>The reality is because of my white privilege, I don't have to live in fear. But I I'm embarrassed, saddened and angered by how the intolerance within much of the law enforcement community is ignored by the elite. "
5394,Sports,"When I was a child, when we went to the theater, they would play the national anthem before the movie. Now they forgo that, and shove 30 minutes of ads and coming attractions down our throats.<br/>It's time to remove this archaic practice of displaying our jingoism on a national scale. Furthermore, putting the military on Parade and flying expensive Jets overhead before a ball game cost incredible amounts of money. If the GOP is so concerned about wasting money, they should dump this practice. And don't give me the bull about it being a great recruiting tool."
5395,Sports,"Weâre talking about the NFL, which recently gave up its nonprofit status. Did they have a sign over the conference room door, â ITS ALL ABOUT THE MONEY.â"
5396,Sports,"Well, Trump must be happy for he likes people to be afraid of him. Sadly, the people leaving the league behind care more about the anthem and/or flag than they care about injustice and their fellow citizens or the very American right to peaceful protest. "
5397,Sports,I wonder who recorded the meeting? It most certainly was not the NFL.
5398,Sports,"I wonder if  in attendence  was a member of the Rooney family owners of the Pittsburgh Steelers who introduced the ""Rooney Rule"" in hiring NFL head coaches. The Rooneys have long been  leaders among NFL owners in doing the right thing."
5399,Sports,I don't care for the act of kneeling during the National Anthem.   I'd suggest that players wear black armbands or some other similar display that calls attention to their cause without offending Veterans like myself or others who cherish America. 
5400,Sports,The President of  the United States should be promoting the countryâs values in a positive manner.<br/><br/>Free speech is one of those values.<br/><br/>Trump attacked a few players in a sport who were exercising their rights to free speech.  He is not promoting American values.
5401,Sports,Meanwhile Trump denigrates patriotic Americans serving their country in the FBI and denigrates war hero John McCain who sacrificed for his country whereas Kaepernick was protesting against police brutality.
5402,Sports,The owners are rich cowards.   Why are they so afraid ?  How much power and money does any one person need.  Stand up for whatâs right.   Including kneeling. 
5403,Sports,If your expecting a bunch of Rich White Billionaires to show one ounce of courage when facing the prospect of losing a penny then you're just the type of individual who will be thrilled to invest in a Bridge in Brooklyn that I decided to offer for a limited time only to select special people like you!<br/><br/>So you don't forget - Order by midnight tonight!
5404,Sports,"These owners obviously did not understand what Kaepernick and other players were addressing. Their fear of Donald Trump's tweet storms is pathetic. A group of people with the clout of NFL owners could immediately turn around the negative fallout from kneeling if they gave their own intelligent employees a forum to explain the issue and then stood (or better yet kneeled) behind them in support of their protest. The fact that they are asking to ""do something"" is ridiculous; players were already doing something. These owners will be remembered sadly as anchors on progress in this country. "
5405,Sports,"Never let it be said that Trump allowed a single race-baiting opportunity to slip through his tiny hands.  Itâs heartening to see white and black players rally around Kaepernick, who has been demonized for expressing his First Amendment rights.  (I wonder how the Right would react if he was kneeling in protest of abortion.)  Most of the owners sound likeâwellâowners, more interested in applying a band-aid than addressing the underlying disease."
5406,Sports,"Robert Kraft refers to Trump's open racism as a ""mission that I don't feel is in the best interests of America"" because it is ""divisive and it's horrible."" Yet he's a ""longtime supporter."" I can only guess that Kraft valued his personal tax cut more than ""the best interests of America."" How despicable. He's lost any respect I ever had for him."
5407,Sports,"Too bad the last sentence in this article didn't end with the words,<br/>"".......and pledged to meet again and continue this work together.""<br/><br/>but instead,<br/><br/>"".......and pledged to meet again and continue to kneel together.""<br/><br/>I don't see change ever happening until 'white america' realizes how, day in and day out, the black community is faced with issues they'll never have to face. <br/><br/>One glaring difference is how black parents, during the early life of their child, will have to decide when to speak with their children about their coming into contact with police officers and how to react so the police do not feel compelled to draw their weapons. <br/><br/>It is undeniale this extremely dark 'right of passage' is something the white community does not have to encounter as their children 'grow up.'"
5408,Sports,"Trump and protests by players are a short-term problem - the bigger problem is the sport as currently designed is killing people at all levels due to CTE. Despite being jilted by the league twice, this St Louis fan could at least be counted on to join in the national celebration of the Super Bowl or a few college bowl games. No more. I would no more watch an NFL game than I would a dog fight. Both are inhumane."
5409,Sports,"What the owners and players forget is, all of the fans  exercising their rigthts to NOT spend THEIR money, was happening long before President Trump."
5410,Sports,I advise the players to take a knee and make the sign of the cross.<br/>Who would argue against genuflecting toward the Flag? Like Tebow?
5411,Sports,Sounds like it was a yawner of a meeting. Not a single thing said that you wouldn't expect would be said.
5412,Sports,Let's all go back to what we were doing before engaging with feckless owners and their employees. The players will be abandoned by the owners. <br/><br/>Nothing will come of this fiasco. I lost my interest in the NFL a long time ago. Walk away. 
5413,Sports,"It's a shame, but sports was one of the last things that people from all walks of life could watch and enjoy and discuss without partisan rancor.  Pro sports is supposed to be entertaining, and fun.  It's not anymore.  I'm taking a knee against the NFL."
5414,Sports,"It's been reported several times and several different ways, NFL ratings are down, not because of streaming, but because the players are kneeling.  The only resolution to the problem, not the players apologizing, but to just stand up during the National Anthem.  And still..... some people may not return.  Further, I am still asking the question, how has inequality become the NFL's problem to resolve?    "
5415,Sports,"The owners worry about their public image being tarnished but they should be backing their team players so long as the players use a peaceful means of protest which is their right as Americans.<br/>However the question that needs to be asked is, are the players on their own time during the Anthem or are they on the job at that time, because technically they shouldn't be on the job until the kick off.<br/>That doesn't seem to have been answered at this meeting."
5416,Sports,"The article says, ""The players sounded aggrieved. After discussing a proposal to finance nonprofit groups to address player concerns, they wanted to talk about why Colin Kaepernick, the quarterback who started the anthem protests to highlight social injustice and police brutality against African-Americans, was, they believed, being blackballed by the owners.""<br/><br/>Don't the ""boys"" know their only reason for being is to make money for their owners?  It's just highly-paid slavery - until they get hurt.<br/><br/>The team that finally hires Mr. Karpernik, who as I understand it is one of the best quarterbacks alive, will get universal support from socially conscious men and women of America and the world. <br/><br/>This is an opportune time for owners to leave their neandrethal ideas behind and honor the black men who have made them weatlhy beyond measure."
5417,Sports,"Yes, the NFL has an image problem. Last year, for the first season ever, this lifelong Steelers fan did not watch one game-- not because of the players protesting but because of the team owners' cluelessness and greed. This article just confirms my disgust was directed appropriately. <br/><br/>Kaepernick doesn't have a job so I've not changed my position."
5418,Sports,It's time for a long-term plan to end the divisiveness. No more talking past each other. A house divided cannot stand.
5419,Sports,"The open questions out of this meeting need to be answered: where will Colin Kaepernick land, and what should be the role of the NFL in speaking out about civil rights and violence?<br/><br/>To those who ridicule pro athletes who wade into politics: too many black men are incarcerated, and our country needs more feasible career options for low and lower-middle income black men besides the military, poverty wage entry level jobs or pie-in-the-sky professional sports contracts. These athletes are speaking out for a future we should help to create, and we should thank them.<br/><br/>And a shoutout to Eagles owner Jeff Lurie for supporting the Democratic party, unlike friends of Trump, Kraft and Brady. BRAVO COACH!"
5420,Sports,"Tim -- there's another saying that maybe Mr. Kraft would do well to heed:  ""People who live in glass houses shouldn't throw stones"".   Whatever his personal complicity, Mr. Kraft's football franchise has without a doubt been the most divisive of all 32.  I won't belabor the Patriots' scandals, but everyone knows them... and they've served the make the Patriots the most hated team in the NFL.    A lot of people view Kraft's, Belachek's and Brady's ACTIONS as ""divisive and horrible"".  "
5421,Sports,"The players are not forced to look to the NFL for employment. There is always a need for rocket scientists, skilled neuro surgeons, brainy lawyers, top flight entrepreneurs and a host of other productive positions that donât generally lead to CTE, broken bones, etc., etc...."
5422,Sports,"What does the national anthem have to do with work, the workplace, or playing football? Nothing, nothing at all. It is essentially a political ritual coopted by pro sports teams for manipulating sentiment and marketing purposes, and by its nature is an appropriate occasion to express dissent, especially (first amendment) if it irritates people. And as for the first amendment, no one's forcing you to ""listen"" or, actually, to look, anyway. "
5423,Sports,So what?  That has zero to do with the issue being discussed.  And having descendent in the military hardly bequeathes honor on the later generation.
5424,Sports,Trump won the Electoral College by extraordinarly narrow margins.<br/><br/>That too is a fact.
5425,Sports,colin did it to himself. He wasnt fired. He Quit!
5426,Sports,But then you simply make the point that Kaepernick's biggest problem with not being on the field is he just isn't that good of a quarterback. Then you add all the baggage and he makes himself unfit for hire.
5427,Sports,Amen to that! You reap what you sow. A bitter pill for the NFL to swallow when the inmates are running the assylum.
5428,Sports,"I think it was great that it was leaked.  It reaffirms that the biggest concern of NFL owners is their bottom line, that they don't care at all about the actual human players on their teams, and that they blackballed Kaepernick. They absolutely have the right to do that, just as fans have the right to boycott, or burn their jerseys, or whatever. Just as the players have a right to express their personal opinions, and protest violence against their persons. As far as I can tell, the only ones who don't have rights in the NFL, are the cheerleaders. "
5429,Sports,There is no such rule requiring players or anyone to stand during the anthem. 
5430,Sports,"Yes, this has never happened before, someone in the service of powerful men not keeping their mouth shut.  <br/><br/>Ethics and pro football owners?  Please. "
5431,Sports,"Big difference!  No one paid to see a protest, they came to see a football game."
5432,Sports,whoever leaked the recording is a whistleblower and I support them!
5433,Sports,"Entertainers have long been involved in politics. They didn't join the military, they can still express opinions. I think the problem you people have is that you don't want to acknowledge the problems they are pointing out."
5434,Sports,"Augustus, intrinsically it has to do with large gatherings of Americans.  Lot's of us are actually proud of our country and happy to salute the flag and stand for the anthem.  "
5435,Sports,"The owners are no more 'financially gluttonous' than they were 5 years ago.  They're in business to make money, not to provide a platform for social justice warriors.  News flash: The NFL and their players are precisely a commodity.  It doesn't make the players non-human, but they are a commodity none the less - a Human Resource.<br/><br/>The decline in ratings is a direct result of owners not having sufficient backbone and smarts to tell the players, as their employees, that they will stand for the National Anthem AND that they are happy to support efforts to provide greater awareness of social injustices.  They could have had a twofer with very little effort but whiffed on both counts.<br/><br/>It also takes courage to stand by your principles and agreements you've made with your employer/ employees.<br/><br/>If watching an NFL game demonstrates condoning ALL of every owner's decisions then there's a long conversation to be had about everything else we buy."
5436,Sports,Very well said.
5437,Sports,"And good thing too, because he almost single handedly destroyed the USFL with his amazing business acumen"
5438,Sports,New rein  good point.  Let's have some me too folks out there.  Diversity no glass ceiling.  Ha
5439,Sports,"Wow, Gold, thanks for confirming the wisdom of millions (including moi) to turn off NFL TV, last fall.<br/><br/>Y'all can't force us to pay people whose actions we do not support. The USA is not yet North Korea, no matter how much the left wing wants to order around, the non-left."
5440,Climate,Morally corrupt coward. Seems to be the general theme lately. 
5441,Climate,"Mr. Pruitt, ill equipped and too miseducated to oversee American biomes or to protect  natural resources and wildlife, belongs on a tight leash, caged - just as he wishes to disarm, disempower and villify every American who honors our nation's natural trust, monetize and destroy it's natural resources and destroy even the last of our endangered species for financial and political gain.<br/><br/>No, perhaps this member of the Trump entourage, above the law, above decency and legislative process wishes to become our natural resources Czar and needs something less than a gilded cage.<br/><br/>Given what so many in our country have done to safeguard natural resources and diminishing species, a life in prison seems more appropriate for this inch of a man, whose meanness, dishonesty and avarice make him a perfect candidate for a prison farm, where he can work in the open air and serve the American public on a chain.<br/><br/>I am revolted by this Trump appointee above all  others. That's saying something."
5442,Climate,"Aside from the vile Pruittâs absurd deflections, did anyone notice this gem:<br/>âCongressional hearings are an opportunity to reiterate the accomplishments of President Trumpâs E.P.A., which include: working to repeal Obamaâs Clean Power Plan and Waters of the United States, providing regulatory certainty, and declaring a war on lead, all while returning to Reagan-era staffing levels,â Mr. Wilcox said.â<br/><br/>Translation: âIn the current administration, we view congressional hearings as just one more opportunity to twist the facts, prevaricate, and lie.â<br/><br/>We are in seriously deep doo-doo as long as this ridiculous lying throwback has a seat at the tableâexcept the one in his cell at Leavenworth. (And letâs hope he takes the clown who hired him and the jokers who lie for him along). "
5443,Climate,WE THE PEOPLE want our $3 million bucks back and Pruitt gone. He's a grifter run amok 
5444,Climate,"Whatever happened to ""the buck stops here""?"
5445,Climate,"Of course, what else can anyone expect from Republicans like Pruitt and Trump? They are the first to castigate others for anything that goes wrong around them and the last to accept any of the blame. Nothing is ever their fault. They lie and cheat their way through life, and do nothing but issue denials when they are caught. I hope they are forced to face the music someday. "
5446,Climate,He sure is not a âthe buck stops hereâ Truman.
5447,Climate,When will it end?
5448,Climate,"Will Senator Elizabeth Warren be one of the members of Congress grilling Pruitt?  She is one of the few Democrats strong enough, smart enough and tough enough to get to the heart of these allegations."
5449,Climate,"This is how it's done in Trumpworld.  The buck doesn't stop anywhere, and if it does, the little people are to blame."
5450,Climate,"I guess the buck doesn't stop with Pruitt, huh. Hs he taken even one course in management? Does he completely fail to understand that managers who have no idea what's going on in their departments, and do not appear able to control subordinates, aren't going to impress people with their leadership abilities? <br/><br/>One can only hope our representatives are paying attention."
5451,Climate,"I was astonished to find that Pruitt was the oldest child in his family.  He reminds me of a bratty, spoiled little kid who does terrible things then goes screaming â WAAAA!! â to Mommy to blame it all on an older sibling.<br/><br/>Time to kick this destructive, greedy creep to the curb."
5452,Climate,"As Richard Painter said, ""EPA now stands for the Environmental Pollution Agency.""  Decades ago, my teacher dad's summer job was to spray insecticide, including DDT, around NY's airports to protect the planes from birds.  He died from stomach cancer. My cousin died from liver cancer after being exposed to Agent Orange in Vietnam a year after he returned. I hoped the bad days of cancerous chemical exposure were behind us. The Trump government has repeatedly broken trust with its citizens, but this, with NY, NJ, CA, and MA's high cancer rates, this is the worst.  Our children's lives are at stake now.  At the very least, let's stop these insane rollbacks for them.  I'm not even addressing the blatant greed and corruption here, which I blame the Supreme Court's decisions on Citizens United for, the wholesale looting of America's trust and the transfer of power to corporations/lobbyists (aka Mulvaney on how congressmen operate)."
5453,Climate,What an odious man. Bent on environmental destruction and personal enrichment. Only Trump would appoint him to the EPA.
5454,Climate,"The attitude that everything is the fault of their predecessors (e.g.,Obama and Bush), or their subordinates, starts at the top with Trump.

5458,Metropolitan,"Why donât you work for your summer estate? You know, like most people do. "
5459,Metropolitan,"NYTimes, thank you so much for the option of commenting on Joyce Wadler's columns again!<br/><br/>My mother never spent any time in assisted living. She lived at her place and died after a brief stay in hospital. So I guess I was lucky..."
5460,Metropolitan,"Forget about Mrs Wadler's inheritance, the resources expended ""warehousing"" elderly people that don't even know where they are or who is in the room with them will be the ruin of our entire society.  The diversion of resources from preventative medicine on the young to keeping elderly Alzheimer patients simply breathing is absurd. Hopefully sometime in the near future, we can all have a reasoned public conversation about the merits of death with dignity.  "
5461,Metropolitan,"My Mother's long term care is slowly eating up her cash reserves, but luckily she started this process in a fairly good position. But think of this. You are concerned about losing your inheritance, but it might be much worse than that in the long run. Republicans have made repeated attempts to kill Medicaid as we know it and that could mean no financial assistance in some states after your Mother's resources are exhausted. Then you would be responsible for those bills on your own and instead of an inheritance you could wind up with a large debt to pay off. As is so often the case, things could always be worse."
5462,Metropolitan,"My mother scrimpted and saved all her life. Her biggest hope was to leave some money to her grandchildren. She set aside $3000f for each of her 3 grandchildren with the strict orders it was never to be used for her care.<br/>At 91 she finally agreed to go to an assisted living place after falling twice in her home.  Her home was sold to pay for her care.  Money was set aside for her funeral expenses.<br/>At 96 she finally went to a nursing home and died 2 months later. All her money was depleted and just before she went into the nursing home we applied for Medicaid because we all could not afford the 24 hour care.  She did have a great funeral and we all celebrated her life. We never expected an inheritance.<br/>Sadly, her wish to leave money to her grandchildren was not honored. In order for her to receive any from Medicaid she had to be penniless.  Funeral expenses are allowed and can be set aside."
5463,Metropolitan,The writer doesn't sound hungry. The aging mother is spending her own money. 
5464,Metropolitan,"I don't find her selfish or self-serving at all. Her article is rather poignant, heart-wrenching and funny too.  The writer acknowledges the filial debt owed to her mother and is glad there is enough money for her care. But which one of us hasn't occasionally had these thoughts knowing how wrong it is and then feel guilty afterwards? We should not be so judgmental unless we are sure we'd never be put in the same shoe as her."
5465,Metropolitan,"A local Board and care or small assisted-living, should be less than in-home care. Also important to speak to an elder care attorney, and explore Medicaid planning."
5466,Metropolitan,"As a geriatrician, I would advise you to speak to an elder care attorney about Medicaid planning. That is what it is there for. Out in San Francisco I see it abuse to protect the $5 million estate of an elder woman, whose children would prefer to have the money and then put her in a more Dickensian facility that excepts Medicaid money."
5467,Metropolitan,"No, certainly not.   She is 88 and in poor health.   I want only the best for her but she changes her mind with every visit.  The drama is we do not know what to expect.   I do not wish to pursue other actions but I fear I will have to, thus further  marring our relationship."
5468,Metropolitan,"Some people donât have hundreds of thousands of dollars to take care of others, and in some countries, elder care does not bankrupt them. There is a problem here besides simple greed.<br/><br/>As an example, I will never forget the caller to NPRâs 1A who talked about how she lives in her car after losing her job taking care of her parents during their last illnesses, which happened in back to back years, and having to pay for housing for her ill brother. She began life as a professional with an office job, and was now cleaning offices or something. It is not being greedy for her to point out that this is untenable."

5471,Sports,"Thanks for cited my paper ""Hyperandrogenic athletes: performance differences in elite-standard 200m and 800m finals""<br/>Ospina Betancurt, J. et al,. (2018) Journal of Sports Science.<br/><a href=""https://www.tandfonline.com/eprint/m3HmEderIZfMdHraEFg6/full"" title=""https://www.tandfonline.com/eprint/m3HmEderIZfMdHraEFg6/full"" target=""_blank"">https://www.tandfonline.com/eprint/m3HmEderIZfMdHraEFg6/full</a><br/><br/>@jaob84"
5472,Sports,"Oneâs chromosome should not define whether one can compete as a woman. Itâs how one defines their gender that should rule.  This is what all girls colleges like Wellesley do when considering whether an applicant is a girl. It should be consistent in sports too.  By the way, if a person who is a student at Wellesley wants to compete in intercollegiate athletic competitions, there should be no chromosome testing in that case either."
5473,Sports,"Talk about sexual discrimination.    Hyperandrogenism is a medical syndrome with severe consequences for those who were born with it.<br/>It is dreadful for the individuals who have it, and they don't choose it.<br/><br/>Medication helps them normalize their cycles and prevent osteopenia, or thinning of their bones.    They are not taking supplements to increase their natural hormone levels.<br/><br/>This makes as much sense as discriminating against runners with longer legs, and telling them they need to shorten their legs to compete.<br/><br/>Men with naturally elevated testosterone, are apparently immune from having to lower their God Given levels.<br/><br/>And what about trans people, are they to be limited also.....<br/><br/>This is nothing short of idiocy.<br/><br/>Where is the logic model for sanity in developing guidelines for athletes?<br/><br/>Virginia Beck, NP"
5474,Sports,"It is not hard to argue that the new rule is unfair (as many of the comments to this article do), but once there is a decision to have a separate competition for women it becomes necessary to specify criteria to determine who is eligible. In the vast majority of cases there will be no issue, regardless of the criteria chosen, but there will always be some athletes who are close to whatever line is drawn and some of those who are on the wrong side of the line (ie., ineligible to compete as women) will complain. It just can't be avoided."
5475,Sports,"The extra testosterone clearly gives them an unfair advantage, so they have to alter this level to allow fair competition. This creates fairness for everyone. "
5476,Sports,"Sports are where cultural norms are challenged.     This is another example.    There should be no mens sports and no women's sports.      Women are more than equal to men and should be allowed to compete against them.      We see this pushed for and taking place in our military, some high school and some college sports.       This should be the norm.     There should not be segregation because one person is physically different from another, this was the standard for Dr. King and should be the standard today.     Let everybody compete and let the best participant win!"
5477,Sports,"Allow all athletes, male and female, to take testosterone supplements with no maximum limit on blood testosterone levels.   Problem solved.  "
5478,Sports,My guess is that the majority of women athletes would support the protocol.
5479,Sports,"That isn't how this works.  You don't just work out hard and your testosterone goes over 5 nanomoles.  All the other top women are naturally under 2.  People will these extraordinary levels have a clear advantage, no different than if a ""normal women"" used drugs to artificially increase her levels.<br/><br/>If you don't want to make them suppress to 2.5x natural maximums, then all women should be allowed to dope up to whatever level you think should be okay."
5480,Sports,There were different sand pits for men and women?  Or are you saying that she jumped farther than the officials thought was even possible for the men?
5481,Sports,"This isnât the same. Semenya doesnât have female sex organs and has internal testicles. A more apt comparison is âthis isnât fair, would you prevent tall men from competing in womenâs basketball?  Would you prevent very strong men from competing in womenâs gymnastics? Should we exclude heavily muscled men from competing in womenâs bodybuilding?  The answer to all of these questions is yes. "
5482,Sports,Fairness means that female athletes should not have to compete (without mitigation) against other female athletes who also happen to have functioning male sexual organs pumping out testosterone.
5483,Sports,"A small percentage of women have congenital conditions which make this the case.  They are still women.  It's not their body that falls short, but your definition."
5484,Well,By using more than one NSAID one is impacting both Cox-1 and Cox-2 pathways by complementary means.  Relying on just one NSAID does not necessarily impact both potential pathways creating prostaglandins (which among other effects cause pain).

5494,Culture,"As a longtime lay Shavian with shelves upon shelves of books by and about GBS, as well as DVDs and recordings of as many plays as I could get ... I think Shaw himself would applaud the 'cross-cultural' casting. It brings to mind my favourite of his creations, the title character of his novella 'Adventures of the Black Girl in Her Search for God'. The Black Girl, young, beautiful, of strong character and with an inquiring mind as yet unmarred by the shibboleths of western 'education', takes literally a missionary's quote of the Gospel to 'seek and ye shall find' God. After encountering the incarnations of several Abrahamic versions, as well as Jesus, Peter, Paul, Muhammad, and Voltaire, she (spoiler!) marries a red-haired, bearded Irishman, and they produce numerous children, 'charmingly coffee-coloured' as Shaw predicted we all someday would be. (My favourite line is the Irishman's comment on Voltaire: 'that auld man is cracked and needs someone to dig his potatores for him. There's a lot been found out about potatoes since he learnt to dig them'. The second part is a line I often use myself to dismiss someone whose opinion seems to me uninformed, under-informed, narrow, etc. :D)<br/>No, what he'd have a problem with is Lerner &amp; Loewe changing the ending of Pygmalion! If violence is being done to Shaw, it's elsewhere on the Great White Way."

5503,Obits,"Of all the ways to demonstrate that the NYT is on the wrong side of history -- and the toxic dead end of identity politics.  By the same internal logic, a woman slavemaster in the American Civil War would be celebrated, with the fixation on identity excusing all else.<br/><br/>The Women's Battalion of Death was a ferociously right-wing grouping, defending the Tsar, then the corrupt Kerensky regime.  When it was on its death throes, the only two forces which mounted opposition to the taking of power by the Bolsheviks were a ragtag assemblage of teenage officer students, and the Women's Battalion of Death.  In an insurrection which was even published in the papers in advance, only these were reactionary enough to come to the aid of the putrefied and repressive regime, whose leader Kerensky had adopted the Tsar's own royal apartments as his own.<br/>Assemble the facts in this article rationally: she travelled abroad offering her services as traitor and Quisling to the twenty-odd nations that invaded Russia, fearing the working-class government.  They used her and manufactured an image to suit their interests.  And then she returned to fight the national liberators. Who was she a martyr to?  Wilson, Clemenceau, and Lloyd George, not the Russian people."
5504,Obits,"I would like to suggest someone who should be included in your list of overlooked women: Mary Somerville, after whom Somerville College at Oxford was named. She was a self-taught Scottish polymath and science writer who, upon her death, was dubbed the Queen of Science. She was reputedly the person for whom the word ""scientist"" was originally coined and was Ada Lovelace's advisor and mentor."
5505,Obits,Amazing initiative by the New York Times. This reminds me of what historians of women have been doing for years: excavating women's lives from the ruins of dismissive patriarchy.
5506,Obits,"There were many women Soviet Army snipers and combat pilots during WW2 that had remarkable martial achievements, some of whom may not have had Times obits. <br/><br/>One example would be the female sniper team of Natalya Kovshova and Mariya Polivanova that has an estimated 300 kills before their deaths which came from a grenade that Kovshova pulled the pin on as German troops entered their trench during a battle in village of Sutoki-Byakovo in August 1942.<br/><br/>Russia and later Vietnam showed that women could excel in combat in conjunction with men. "
5507,Obits,"This is cool. Thanks for doing this, but come to think of it, there will always be people who deserve recognition throughout history all around the world who will always be overlooked. Mothers, for example."
5508,Obits,"âAll night long my nerves were taut and my fists busy,â she wrote. âI continued to rain blows til the bell rang at five oâclock.â<br/><br/>Perhaps some of the women who report that they can't locate the door when they find themselves on a bad date could take some inspiration from Bochkareva."

Perhaps itâs because Iâm a flutist, but Iâve never shied away from Tchaikovsky, Iâve never been skittish of the Goldberg Variations.<br/><br/>	It is a great tragedy when we think of classical music as being haughty, or the sort of music that only plays in art galleries. When we constrict concertos to being things that exist in certain parts of our lives, we miss out on the humanity of music. Let classical music bleed into the modern era. Let your heartbreaks align with the great crescendos of cellos. Let your life fall into a handful of 4/4 measures, and then, and perhaps only then, will you learn to appreciate music the way it was meant to be appreciated.<br/><br/>	The best way to watch a concert where classical music is being played is to simply not watch at all. Close your eyes. Let your mind wander as the orchestra carries you through major and minor, through tempos you can feel throughout your entire body. Donât let yourself be intimidated. "
5519,Upshot,"The labor pool is tight, cost of money is going up and gas is approaching $3.00 a gallon.  Oh yes, the dollar has been taking a dive.  All those wonderful cheaper imported goods, wonât be as cheap in the future.<br/>There is no maybe about inflation headed our way."
5520,Upshot,"It takes an extreme act of reductionist thinking to say that inflation is low at the same time housing is recovering. <br/><br/>The economy is a single machine with many moving parts that all influence each other. Housing is the biggest expense that most people face, and as it increases faster than wages, people have less to spend on other things. It might be a harbinger of a recovering economy, but it is also a massive headwind to the economic health of ordinary people. <br/><br/>This has not been an era of low inflation, it has been an area of mismatched inflation. Housing and medical care have inflated at historically robust levels, while other, more discretionary goods and services have not. So massive amounts of money flow out of the discretionary economy and into the necessities.<br/><br/>Is it a surprise that the discretionary economy has low inflation because the necessities are gobbling up more than their share of most peoples' income?"
5521,Upshot,"Risk is a component of interest rates and inflation. When the leader of the world's largest economy behaves erratically, and even irrationally, several forms of risk are increased. It is no coincidence that as Trump has accelerated the uncertainty surrounding tariffs, trade treaties, and even a personal hostility towards some of the largest businesses and industries on the planet, investment markets have become more volatile.<br/><br/>More volatility (risk) requires greater returns to attract savings and investment dollars. That is accomplished by higher interest rates on the savings side. Investments must either show a greater expected return or a lower price per share. If the returns on investment decline in the context of rising debt and dismantled financial regulations, however, we could find ourselves in the same deflationary spiral that crippled economies worldwide less than a decade ago. So far, a debt-fueled tax stimulus package is helping to postpone that day of reckoning."
5522,Upshot,"Wrong! Republicans do know how to manage the economy for their principal constituents - the rich and the oligarchs. How else to explain their incessant reduction in taxes while increasing public spending. They just manage the economy for the 1% ers, not the balance of the population."
5523,Travel,"I lived in Denmark and worked in CHP for 5 years and regretted it.<br/><br/>A car is taxed at 128%, income at around 60%, 25% VAT tax on everything you buy to include food, housing is insanely expensive and if you want to buy a home, get ready to pay for a tear down you will throw even more money into buying over priced home repair products.<br/><br/>You also get to pay $50 tax on every TV and computer you own every year.<br/><br/>Denmark was in the middle of closing down many hospitals leaving cities outside of CPH with really nothing in terms of heath care and urgent needs.<br/><br/>The quality of care is dubious given my first hand experience and the amount you pay in income tax for your ""free healthcare"". After an entire year of going to my assigned doctor (based on my zip code), I was told there was no problem. However, I ended up in the emergency room with a burst appendix which should have been detected had the doctor done any blood testing at all, which he did not. I went septic and almost died. <br/><br/>In addition, the increasing crime in Denmark is troublesome. The first weekend after I moved to Denmark I was in CPH when they had shut down a squatters house and they city broke out into a chase of thousands of people across the city in a mobile phone cat and mouse game. That was the same day I went to the CPH city square where thousands of men were gathered and jumping up and down yelling ""Yeah, Yeah Pakistan""! <br/><br/>The white wash of what is really happening in Europe is troubling, but yet not surprising."

5535,Arts&Leisure," While I wish somebody would sweep the leg, What's way funnier is looking at the third picture down -- the one from the original movie. I love how they put the word ""Referee"" on the 2 people that clearly don't look they are competing to begin with. I guess without that designation, could have been a tag team event. Red shirt is a general tell (I think thats what Star Trek did to guarantee someone would not last throughout the scene). No matter how good this may be, someone in Hollywood needs an original idea because it seems they keep regurgitating films."
5536,Arts&Leisure,"I watched and enjoyed the original movie, but I honestly had no idea how much I needed this until I saw the trailer. When Johnny's student knocks a female student down, apologizes profusely, only to see her jump up, roaring, and pummel him? Then Johnny looks at her approvingly and says, ""Girl's a natural Cobra Kai."" CHILLS, people! And I'm not gonna lie: I got a little misty, too. It looks great!"
5537,Arts&Leisure,"Good grief. Save me from this insanity, please. Has every single creative person decided to remake big hits of the past instead of actually creating something new and wonderful? Apparently, like Hollywood studio executives, YouTubers are unable to do it. <br/><br/>Perhaps they should be called YouRubers. "
5538,Arts&Leisure,"It has been well documented that although Johnny was not exactly a great guy, Daniel meets the true definition of a bully in the original movie. <br/><br/>The idea that a new series will involve old rivals using young proteges (presumably adolescents) to fight in their stead, is yet another example of how manipulative people use others to resolve their own issues. "
5539,Arts&Leisure,"Only 80s kids know what this means to 80s kids :)  I love that in this reboot, Johnny Lawrence, the blonde haired bully, turns into the Mr. Miyagi for a new group of high school kids.  The irony is explosive.  I agree that Johnny and Daniel seemed to have made up as the final credits rolled in the original (""you're allright, kid!"") - but I like the idea that Johnny went downhill at some point and needs to rebuild himself in midlife.

5547,Climate,"Pruitt is a liar and a snake.  He needs to resign and so do the liars who are agreeing with him in Congress.  I have never head so much ignorance in my life.

A person who has to be told he should be saving taxpayer's money by not flying first class on frivolous trips, who needs to be reminded that it is his job to know what the salary and hiring policies are for his agency and when buying a private phone booth for more than many people can afford for a down payment on a house is inexcusable.  <br/><br/>Then in addition to the mismanagement of the agency are the policies it is pursuing which do not reflect the needs or wishes of the American public.   He should resign and he should take Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke and other incompetents with him."
5553,Climate,The man has a bulletproof desk.  Does he think someone is going to shoot him in his knees?  
5554,Climate,"Blame the Democrats.   They keep approving these incompetent, corrupt people picked by Trump and then they spend capital and energy trying to get rid of them.   They just approved Pompeo and now they are bringing his ghosts out of the closet.   Pruitt, Mulvaney, and Zinke are all worthless, yet, they got there by wooing some dumb Democrats.   What is wrong with them?   Do they like Trump tire marks on their faces?   Obviously."
5555,Climate,"Pruitt is a real winner. I think that he and his family should drink some of the polluted water that he is allowing to be created with his loosening of EPA regulations. The P in EPA = Protection!!! He is not a protector, he is a polluter. Good riddance. I hope that Trumps get rid of him, but that's hoping a bit too much.   "
5556,Climate,"Just saw Congressman Barton praise Pruitt in dismantling President Obamaâs âradical clean air policiesâ...<br/><br/>The Republicans and the administrationâs apologists are now reduced to caricatures spouting sound bites that poll well with their voters and the self-reinforcing loop of drivel that constitutes news on right wing media.<br/><br/>So, according to the âgentlemanâ from Texas: clean air is now âradicalâ??!"

Do you really and truly believe they are not all in on this scam? Why? <br/><br/>According to republicans, OF COURSE Pruitt has every bit of business running the EPA, because it has been a long-term fervent desire and goal to DESTROY IT. And when they move Pruitt into another role inside the regime they will install someone who's even worse. "
5568,Science,"The question we should be asking is why our own long evolved, healthy immune system is not continuing to destroy  these cancer cells on a daily basis, as they no-doubt have been for millions of years.   We know, since the 1930's research of Hans Selye with his ""stressed"" lab animals, that a key component of the immune system, the thymus gland (where T-lymphocytes originate), is shrunken and destroyed by high stress levels, and that the stress hormone ""cortisol"" is the culprit.   We are admittedly living very stressful lives today, so why can't our elevated cortisol levels be the culprit in our cancer epidemic?   Read ""Stress R Us"" for details on Amazon.   Good luck!"
5569,Science,Is this the best use of scarce dollars when one tenth of that sum invested into prenatal care would have more bang for the buck?<br/>I'm glad I don't have to play god. 
5570,Science,"If we limit these conversations to a utilitarian cost-benefit analysis then we should let preemies, whose medical care run up into the millions die.  We already have enough people on this planet.  The same can be said for people with chronic medical issues who rely on expensive treatment over their lifetime.  Their $5000 a month drug could be used to save thousands of people in other countries by giving them simple vaccines.  But that's not how it works and I bet if it was your family member in that situation you wouldn't be talking about rationing medical treatment.<br/><br/>If you have terminal cancer and your doctor said ""I have this treatment that may do nothing or may cure you"" why wouldn't you want to take it.  You're dying anyway.  And if they can learn more about immunotherapy through your treatment then isn't there a benefit?"
5571,Science,"These medical interventions look like the inhumane flip side of ""mercy killing"". Everyone should have an advanced medical directive (living will) and have long definitive conversations with person given medical power of attorney. <br/><br/>The other problem with these so-called 'desperation' measures is that they are extremely expensive and resource-eating. Too many poor people are dying from completely curable conditions simply because they are poor. These 'desperation' measures hike up medical costs across the board, so that a few people with resources can have their lives prolonged by a couple months or a couple years, while people without resources get months and years hacked off their lives for lack of rather ordinary health care. "
5572,Science,"For the somehow incomprehending posters who say why spend so much money to prolong a life for a for months... This therapy offers a complete cure for some patients, not all of whom are in their seventies."
5573,Science,"I think you have missed the point of the article.   There are hundreds of immunotherapy drugs that are in various phases of clinical trials.  Clinical trials have very strict protocols and are expensive for the drug companies to run and it's not just the cost of the drug but also all the extra scans and tests that have to be documented before, during and after the trials.  Ethics panels have to approve who can participate.  Doctors cannot offer experimental drugs as long as there is a standard care for the condition.  When there is no longer a standard of care, at that point the patient may be eligible for a drug trial.  Such patients must be fully informed as to the possible side effects. all the risks and that there may be no benefit.  There is a good chance that the participation will benefit others as the studies proceed and the results are published.  Trials build on previous trials.  As the article points out, not enough is known about which patients can benefit and which cannot.  Eventually, when a great deal more research is completed, immunotherapies will replace chemotherapies and the other treatments that are so debilitating.  There is no 'market' until the trials show safety and efficacy and get FDA approval.   The same companies that make the chemo drugs are involved in developing the new drugs that will replace the old ones when they are proven more effective.  They also pay for the trials for combinations of chemo and immuno to see if they work better together."
5574,Science,"""Because what good is giving patients a highly expensive, experimental drug, if records are not kept, and cancer doctors and researchers do not communicate with each other and share their results?""<br/><br/>It's a no-brainer that records should be kept  and info forwarded to the relevant people involved in making the drug.<br/><br/>However, what good is it if that isn't done? If the patient lives, I""d say that the answer is pretty obvious."
5575,Science,i agree with you.  my point is why wait?
5576,Science,"Because the risks may be much higher that the chance of a benefit.  It would be unethical for a doctor to prescribe an experimental high risk treatment as long as there are treatments that are considered standard care and have been approved for the condition and the stage of the disease.<br/>For example, if standard treatment A has a 60% chance of response and experimental treatment B has a less than 1% chance, which would it be reasonable to opt for?  After all standard care has been tried and failed, it would make sense for some people to opt for treatment B either as a clinical if they are eligible or if their doctor can arrange for it through other means as a last resort with no guarantees and a possibility of severe adverse effects."
5577,Science,"And you can live another 20 years or so, well cared for!"
5578,Science,"I actually worked with medical EMR data.  Unfortunately, I never found one that was secure, mainly due to human error by users or improper access by ""legitimate"" users, as well as poor security design.  The bigger, de-identified research datasets were actually safer, much harder to pick out an individual in a huge dataset.  And there was no data of real interest to thieves.  Unfortunately, I've come to believe that if sensitive information is on a server, privacy is an illusion."
5579,Science,"Perhaps all those people who became terribly ill with e-coli the past few weeks should request hospice care instead of intensive care treatment? After all, they are going to die someday.<br/><br/>And what about expensive open heart surgery or all those wasteful organ transplants that are done each year? That costs a fortune!"
5580,Science,Isn't it usually drug manufacturer  who pays for them?
5581,Science,"Miracles are not free even if they are covered by insurance. The rest of us have to pay for mostly useless and very expensive treatment. This is like the rush to do bone marrow transplants to cure breast cancer. No, it was not a cure but a very expensive money making proposition for the hospitals that rushed to open departments to do it. Everyone is not guaranteed a long life. The medical business should stop torturing people to death when what they need to do is prescribe more opioid painkillers. It won't matter if the patients become addicted. "
5582,Science,"Before such treatments are initiated, a patient must be given all the relevant information about the associated risks.  In these cases the risks can be great and the chance for a good outcome very small.  The patient must be competent to make such a decision.  How is that raising false hopes?  It is not a miracle that some outcomes are better than others.  It is a mystery that will eventually be solved as research continues.  The research depends on patients and doctors who are willing to take part.  The sooner the mysteries are solved, the sooner appropriate treatments will become cheaper and save both money and lives."

On matters of life &amp; death, grave importance to  everyone, he says what ever he feels like, Only to change it, sometimes in the same speech.

The new boss is destroying, because that's all he knows how to do.  "
5585,OpEd,"     A brilliant exposure of illusions that actually plagues both parties.  No sense of responsibility for real victims is possible in a society that wants to be free of barbaric violence without curbing gun rights and abortion; that wants a social and medical safety net--and fiscal responsibility--without vigorous taxation; that wants to castrate and limit the capacity of government to discharge its serious responsibilities in these areas; and that expects to exert a jingoistic and racist nationalism without serious harm both to its internal cohesion and its international credibility and power.  Thomas Jefferson said it best:  ""A people that expects to be both ignorant and free wants what never was and never will be.""  The leadership of both major parties needs to ingrain this wisdom in its core or expect never to be able seriously to govern the American people."
5586,OpEd,"Bush senior called out trickle down economics as voodoo economics and raised taxes because it was necessary due to Reagan's deficits.  He kept the gulf war short and sweet, no regime change, just a reminder that Saddam Hussein needed to stay in Iraq.  I always find it a little sad that his brief presidency will always be overshadowed by the collosal failure of his namesakes presidency.<br/><br/>Going forward the GOP will be the party of Bush Jr and Trump.  I know that when I see an R next to a candidates name I can't bring myself to vote for them because that R stands for never ending war, economic ruin, and blatant racism.  Trump has damaged their brand but it didn't start with him.  "
5587,Styles,What does this hetero couple have to do with the lesbian and gay parents discussed in the referenced study? This article is a tad incoherent.
5588,Styles,"Iâm glad that Iâm an English speaker - I canât imagine the daily affront to LGBTQ values that would occur if I had to speak Spanish or French, where even nouns have grammatical genders. <br/><br/>If I want to go out for some âcyclismeâ, what right does the French language have to tell me that itâs going to be a masculine bike ride, and not a feminine one? Or perhaps a gender neutral bike ride? Or perhaps a bike ride that starts off masculine, then transitions to a feminine one, and then from there to a gender-neutral one?<br/><br/>Good for the NYT to bring attention to things like this. I would have been blind to the sensitivities of what must be dozens and dozens of people across the United States."
5589,Styles,"I am very confused by this article, at least the part that refers to the couple Amanda and Isaac. Reading through the comments, it's clear that many of your other readers are also confused by this article. <br/><br/>Amanda says that she and Isaac pass as a ""straight couple,"" and looking at the photos, I would guess that the vast majority of people in the world who would come into contact with them would assume that they are a heterosexual couple. It's not clear to me what makes them ""queer,"" an identity that they say they want to affirm. Is Amanda a biological female or male? (I'm guessing female because it says she welcomed her ""firstborn child"".) Is Isaac a biological female or male? Does one or both of them identify as trans?  You don't make any of this clear, so it's very hard to understand some of their statements. <br/><br/>I took several journalism classes in college, and one thing I learned is that clarity is very important. This article definitely lacks it."
5590,Styles,"This is too funny. The couple pictured decided not to use dad, but instead âAbba,â which means father (dad) in Hebrew. So you can take the same word, translate it into another language, and it becomes acceptable?<br/>Me thinks these folks have too much time on their hands. "
5591,Styles,"Why not let the kid decide? My son called us ""Massi"" and ""Papi"" (words he made up as combinations of our first names and the terms mama/papa) until he was 4, then (entirely on his own) he started calling us ""Melissa"" and ""Chris"" and, sometimes ""Mommy"" and ""Daddy"". We're fine with any of these, and will be fine with whatever he comes up with as he gets older. "
5592,Styles,"I don't really have a major problem with this. <br/><br/>Let's also cast a critical eye at what some hetero parents ask their kids to call them. It's not just universally 'Mommy' and 'Daddy'. <br/><br/>Some fathers expect their children, especially their sons, to call them 'Sir'. What is being conveyed there? Has anyone examined that with as much scrutiny as whatever queer folks get up to?"
5593,Styles,"To all of you people who are getting angry and calling people crazy for living their lives the way they want and saying that this is too far for you to deal with or whatever...this is just an article reporting a phenomenon, not a persuasion piece. Are you all just upset that people with different identities/ways of living their life (that donât harm anyone as far as I can tell) arenât being hated on or treated as âweirdosâ in a popular news outlet? Then, just wow. <br/><br/>These people are not your parents. You do not have have to call them by these names. And kids call parents all sorts of different things in every language anyways, itâs just an extension of that variation in new social circumstances. <br/><br/>And as far as transgender peoplesâ pronouns, which are brought up a lot by a lot of people reacting angrily to this article, unless you know a transgender person personally or professionaly, you donât have to do know/say/do anything about pronouns. If you do know someone who is transgender, then theyâll of course dislike you for treating them disrespectfully if your donât use their pronouns. Itâs pretty simple and not too demanding, trust me.<br/><br/>Also I donât understands why having articles about transgender or gender non conforming folks is so upsetting. You donât even have to read this, people! (much less write an angry/targeted rant at a group of people that deals with negative attention all the time...)<br/><br/>-a transgender woman "
5594,Styles,"So after all the drama, they settled on ""Mama"" and ""Abba"" (the Hebrew term for father.)<br/>How important and what was the point of this exercise?  Why is this even covered? "
5595,Styles,"All I have to say is right on. I grew up in a heteronormative world where the only gender non-conforming people were the transgender prostitutes on Jerry Springer. <br/><br/>As a transgender woman married to another transgender woman, I can say if we adopt that there for sure wont be gender indoctrination a la societies desires. I thought there was no way I could be transgender because I didn't like ""girly"" stuff. As a transgender woman who doesn't glorify the MAC lifestyle I can say I welcome anything that breaks from gender stereotypes. Men can like dresses and women can like 4x4s and equality is derived from that breaking of stereotypical gender roles. Transgender women aren't all girly girls and there are some very feminine transgender men, just like how their are tomboys and butch women. The world is grey. We are finally breaking through the black and white to reality. <br/><br/>Welcome to the future. Humanity struggles to get better but it does tend towards betterment. "
5596,Styles,Mother is such an important psychological and emotional part of our consciousness. Father is such an important psychological and emotional part of our consciousness.  Changing these important names and the concepts underlying them cannot be of any benefit to their innocent child. It seems that the result of this will stunt the development and sense of safety of their child.  Maybe their child will seem well adjusted but there will be a hole in his heart where he wishes that he had a mother and a father in every sense of the word.  
5597,Styles,"This is not new. When I was a student nurse in my OB rotation back in the late 70's, I encountered young moms who did not want to be called mom, just wanted to use their first name. They also hated Mrs. and preferred Ms. even when married.  I knew kids who would say, my dad likes to be called Bob, and plenty of grandparents who use other names, like Glama-Gama (seriously). So, it really is not a new trend. Just a tired one. <br/><br/>Get over yourselves already. You are still mom and dad or mom and mom or dad and dad, regardless of your self-stated moniker. And you are still a grandparent when you have grandchildren. Stating a cool name will not make you younger. <br/><br/>Just sayin.... "
5598,Styles,"Starting in 1968, we were ""name"" and ""name"" to our first born, and that continued to the later children.  Mommy?  Daddy?  We were people, and we had names -- carried on to this day.  What is the big deal here?"
5599,Styles,"Hello MATHER, hello MADDIE.<br/>Here I am at Camp LGTB.<br/>Camp is rather entertaining.<br/>Letters home however, fluid, non binary"
5600,Styles,"Umm... âThe label is not the role. Being a parent is being a parent,â she said. âItâs actually quite interesting that we donât have a de-gendered parenting label in English, but in the 21st century our roles are far less gendered.â<br/>I think the word she is struggling for is PARENT,  a non gendered noun, not an adjective. And yes, I realize that she apparently is looking for another word to describe various gender identification individuals and their relationship to their child, but come on..."
5601,Styles,"Phew! I felt really dumb until I read the comments from other readers. I didn't understand the purpose of this article nor the attitude of this couple. I also agree that when the Times publishes things like this, it just feeds the Trump base. However, my takeaway is that this couple does love their child. I'm just surprised that they named their son such a gender specific name."
5602,Styles,Exhausting and ridiculous: people who can't get enough attention....and who are constantly trying to conjure up new and unusual ways to grab it.
5603,Styles,"I have a bottle of champagne at the ready and I hope I live long enough - for when this LGBT stuff is finally an era of our history and no longer front page news.<br/>It wasn't long ago that the crazy right, Fox News, etc. talked about 'The Gay Agenda' and I ridiculed them. In fact they saw it coming."
5604,Styles,"THIS! is why we lose elections.  This is insanity on steroids.  There is NOTHING wrong with Mom and Dad,,,,Mother and Father,,,,Grandmother and Grandfather.  These are not EVIL words.  THIS is why we lose elections and people like Trump win."
5605,Styles,"Maybe I'm just slow, but I've missed something.  Amanda and Isaac are partners.  He has a male name and appears (in the picture) to be a man.  She has a female name and appears to be a woman.  She considers herself ""queer-identified"" but her partner is apparently a male.  What did I miss that the article didn't specifically state?  Is she a lesbian in a partnership of convenience? Is he really a woman pretending to be a man?  Is one of them formerly of the opposite sex?  If nothing of the sort is in play, how does she claim to be ""queer-identified"" (Does that mean lesbian?  If so, why doesn't she just say lesbian, a word everyone understands?)  If something pertinent is unmentioned, why hasn't the article mentioned it?<br/><br/>And what's wrong with ""Mommy"" and ""Daddy""?  She settles on ""Mama"", and her partner, who wishes to be genderless, ""Abba"", which is simply Hebrew for father.  Why is he going so far out of the way not to be a ""he,"" a ""him,"" or a ""Mr.""?  Is he gay?  And if he is, why is he with a woman?<br/><br/>The only logical conclusion is that these two are a perfect match for each other--both equally so far onto the path of social justice warrior that they can't see that they can't just will language, Humpty Dumpty style, to fit their whims?<br/><br/>She says ""we don't look visibly queer.""  Well, duh.  You're a woman partnering with a man, absent any other specific explanation.  You aren't as queer as you think you are.  <br/><br/>""We pass as straight""...just like Rachel Dolezal can pass as white."
5606,Styles,"Whatever.  Children adapt pretty quickly and their family is their normal.  Most kids thought want to be ""normal"" even in today's culture which supposedly appreciates the quirky and accepts the different.  When your parents are too different  you want to be ""normal"", when your parents are too normal, you want to be different.  Such is life.  Little Felix will probably end up being your average ""Joe"".   "
5607,Styles,"What genius heroes!<br/><br/>Please quit this narrative -- that everything is wrong with the world and there's so much sadness, oppression, and hostility that this new age/wave of thinking is the only element that can save us. The world has never been better and our quality of life is quite good. Have we run out of real problems for THIS to be news? "
5608,Styles,Eyes rolled back so far I can see my own occipetal lobe. 
5609,Styles,My daughter calls me âdaddyâ and my husband âpapa.â I never realized how conventional we are.
5610,Styles,"As many in this forum have already pointed out, parents should be more concerned about the welfare and the well-being of their children and less about ideology and labels at any cost. One striking example of the same phenomenon, but related to the gender identity of the children, is featured in a recent episode of NPR's Hidden Brain (<a href=""https://www.npr.org/templates/transcript/transcript.php?storyId=555180786)"" title=""https://www.npr.org/templates/transcript/transcript.php?storyId=555180786)"" target=""_blank"">https://www.npr.org/templates/transcript/transcript.php?storyId=555180786)</a>. In it the host, Shankar Vedantam, tells the story of a (straight) couple who try to raise their daughter free of gender stereotypes -- something in itself commendable, given society's predilection for rigid dichotomization of gender roles, but in this particular case driven way beyond the edge. <br/><br/>Ironically, at the end of the day, extreme relativism simply becomes absolutist!"
5611,Styles,"Call yourselves whatever you want, but donât do it in the third person!<br/><br/>I chuckle every time I hear a woman tell her kid, âGive that to mommy,â or a man pleading, âDaddy wants you to stop screaming!â<br/><br/>I always spoke to my children in the first person, and this new phenomenon is absolutely laughable."
5612,Styles,"So, this is a man and a woman who had a baby, as men and women have been doing for as long as thereâs been a human race?<br/><br/>âSo in some ways, our choice of names helps us affirm our identities.â<br/><br/>Well, thatâs what being a parent is all about: you. <br/><br/>Itâs weird, I use to âidentityâ as left wing. I believe in an equitable distribution of income through progressive taxation, healthcare free at the point of use, free or low-cost education from kindergarten to university and the equality of all people before the law. But I refuse to believe nonsense and deny science. If that the purity test, then I am no longer of the left. This is getting beyond insane. We need to wake up. "
5613,Styles,Remind me why I care what these folk do?
5614,Styles,"I look at Amanda and Isaac and see a man in a sport coat and tie, and a woman in a dress with a hair bow. I don't see people with complex gender identities and sexualities.<br/><br/>The grumpy old lady part of me wonders if they're trying to be more interesting than they really are (hey, I'm also in my early 40s with little kids, and I freely admit to becoming a great bore) or if they're looking to find a reason to be annoying or offended when someone ""misgenders"" them. I wonder if their complex sexualities aren't somewhat theoretical as they're married and won't have time or energy with kids to explore non-monogamy.<br/><br/>But mostly, I just think, okay, whatever. It's their life to live, and their kid to raise, and they can do what they want. Lots of us who grew up in traditional homes didn't leave those homes unscathed by minor emotional traumas, you do you.<br/><br/>But I also kind of think actual queer people are being hurt by pseudo queers when they decide they're going to be all complicated and interesting and like being called ""sissy man."""
5615,Styles,"New parents and the rest of us should try to suppress our own precious egos and stop new language acrobatics for ""I, me"" and just focus on ""us"" in the big sense. The first person singular is not working too well for the planet. All of us don't want to be like Trump, right?"
5616,Styles,As an LGBT Mom I thought I would weigh in.  Our kids are teens now but at the start we wanted them to call us Mama and Mommy.  They now call us both Mom most of the time.  When they really want something they will call me Mommy!  It can be a bit confusing if we are both nearby.  Then they will say other Mom.  It's workable.  We wanted the kids to feel like they called us something similar to their friends and we want to also have the respect of the title as their Mom. 
5617,Styles,"""The duoâs ambivalence about traditional monikers is reflected in a study, currently under peer review, on the naming practices in same-sex adoptive families."" Of course: Journalism 101 does demand reference to a study (even one with with just 80 participants) to give a bit of scientific gloss to a contrived story.    "
5618,Styles,Not our place to judge these types of family dynamics. Private.
5619,Styles,"Under any other circumstances, it would be unremarkable to conclude that different cultural groups will often have unconventional terms of address for immediate family."
5620,Styles,Of course they do.  Of course.<br/><br/>Why does this matter to the 98% of us who are not part of this progressive-protected grouping?
5621,Styles,I've got the perfect mindset to fix this issue:<br/><br/>I don't care. It's none of my business.
5622,Styles,"I live in a two-mommy household.  From the time my daughter was born, other adults have obsessed about this name issue.  ""What does she call you?""  Well, I am Mommy [my first name], and my wife is Mommy [her first name].  Not complicated.<br/>I also want to point out that even in our very welcoming and tolerant community my children get questions from other children about the two mom situation.  ""Is that your grandma?"" one little girl asked about me.  At one point my daughter actually invented a father who lived overseas just so she would have an answer to ""Do you have a dad?""  I agree with the other commenters that parents should be focusing on the needs of the child first and then worrying about their own self-identity issues.  A child is not able to understand these issues, especially during the years when they will be calling their parents mommy/daddy/papa/etc.  "
5623,Styles,"hard working hospital staff just want to make these details as simple as possible, and I prefer they focus on paying attention to the medical stuff, thank you. as far as nomenclature, typically the mother is the person who gestates and gives birth. the father is the one that supplies sperm that fertilizes the egg.  In those terms there is no situation in which there is not a mother and a father. But life is not a biology lesson, and probably first name basis is the way to go. "
5624,Styles,"I am just so happy that I am old enough that I am running out of the forest and not into it. The forest is getting way too dense. Under the guise of just wanting to be accepted, every fringe group seems to want to divide and subdivide so as to make someone (like me) feel like they're walking through a landmine avoiding the perpetually offended. To try to understand and remember every individuals preferences for name, pronoun, 3-4 hyphenated gender identity is just silly. I live and let live. Everyone has the right to not be abused or limited by whatever you think you are, but that does not mean you have the right to be accepted for every category you choose to declare yourself as."
5625,Styles,"Perhaps we should let the child discover and choose what they want to call their parents.  After all, it's their perceptions that are the most important, and they can change with time."
5626,Styles,"It REALLY doesn't matter to the rest of us what people call themselves. As long as the children are well loved and well cared for, it's their business. Just don't assume the rest of us will be accommodating your new labels."
5627,Styles,"The only real guidepost for parenthood is doing what's best for the kids. It's not always easy to do, but it comes with the job. Over time, the children will let them know what they need to call their parents. I hope the parents are listening with their hearts."
5628,Styles,"I'm gay, but I find it irritating that an article like this should warrant any real estate in the Times. The lengths people will go to in order to distinguish themselves is maddening sometimes. The apparently endless proliferation of identities (both group and individual) is divisive and polarizing. No one seems terribly bothered that we keep finding ways to cordon ourselves off from each other. Adults ought to strive to be good parents/guardians and to raise good children and to do so through their own good example. Getting over oneself is a good first step toward accomplishing this. Gender identity is well downstream of character. Labels, pronouns, invented words and syntax - it's all so silly and superficial."
5629,Styles,"I look forward to the day when our world is so safe, so clean, so free, and so prosperous that this actually merits a front page article.  Until then, I truly do not care what terminology children use to refer to their legal guardians, and neither should anyone else."
5630,Styles,I always accepted the fact that once you have kids then life is no longer all about you. But maybe that is being reset by the selfie generation.
5631,Styles,This makes me mad at first but then I think about it a bit more and decide I don't really care. They can do whatever they want.
5632,Styles,Our daughter called her father âmumâ for her year of speaking. Then papa. Now at age 5 weâre on porcupine. Who knew we were practicing cutting edge parenting. (Insert my sarcastic eye roll). What my kid calls me (mama kitty btw) is the least of my daily parenting concerns. 
5633,Styles,"I'm 100% in support of LGBQT rights, but please remember your children need to grow up in the world as it is, which is already hard enough. Don't make it harder than it needs to be, and don't fall into the trap of pushing your rejection of norms on them in the same way you fear the world will push norms on them. They're kids, not mini-spokespeople."
5634,Styles,"That poor kid will be the only one in class who has a muzzie and dather and wonder where mom and dad are. <br/><br/>Honestly, think about your kid and not yourselves"
5635,Styles,"Zaza and Mama seem about right for Isaac and Amanda.  If I were in a situation like this, nicknames based on parents' first names would be the way to go for me.<br/><br/>Also, I can't imagine two wives or two husbands.  Why aren't we using the gender-neutral term ""spouse"" for each of the couple?  If the words wife and husband have traditionally been gender-specific, why would any LBGTQ want either designation?  And if we want gender equality, let's not call the ""dominant"" spouse the husband and the ""submissive"" one a wife; it defeats the goal for equal partnership and worth.<br/><br/>I don't see any stigma here, except in the imagination of queer couples, and in the tsk-tsk of biased fools.  Have your children call you by the names you teach them to use....."
5636,Styles,"From shaming to -- finally -- naming, they are now parents in deed. May they shame the rest of us with their love for their adoptive children and the glorious lives their children have in front of them."
5637,Styles,"I'm not sure how using another language to say ""mother"" and ""father"" or ""mom"" and ""dad"" is rejecting gender identity. ""Mama"" and ""baba"" are mother/mom and father/dad in Chinese (and maybe in other languages as well). Using those terms is the exact same as being called mom and dad, it's just in a different language...<br/><br/>What you're called seems like such a minor detail as parents, I'm not sure why this is even an issue. Are they going to refuse to acknowledge their child if he chooses to call them mommy and daddy? I highly doubt it."
5638,Styles,"It's true that the first thing is for kids to be safe and have parents who love them. But this seems guaranteed to confuse kids, who, like it or not, do partly understand and sort the world in terms of gender. And that's good.  It's real. We shouldn't be experimenting with their emerging psyches like this, or trying to force them into some artificial, gender-neutral coding of their own parents that doesn't comport with anything in the real world. Kids aren't stupid. If they have two moms, they know that they have two moms, and making them call one of you ""Maddie"" will not change that. It will just feed your ego (Aren't we great?  We're completely dismantling conventional gender ideologies right here in our own home!) while confusing them and everyone else.  Beyond that, if my kids had started calling me ""Sissy Man,"" instead of ""Mom,"" I'm not sure who would have ended up in the psychiatrist's office first. "
5639,Styles,"Forget about confusing stuff like Dom and Mad. What about Isaac and Amanda?<br/>Yeah, I know those names are both gender conforming, but the parents seem cool with them. Why wouldnât the kid? "
5640,Styles,I really could care less about how they want their kids to call them. I just hope they do not force schools to do the same thing. 
5641,Styles,Not everyone sees this kind of thing as something to celebrate.
5642,Styles,"Perhaps at some point,<br/>they might consider having Felix call them<br/>""Isaac"" and ""Amanda."" <br/><br/>Why do parents need a title?"
5643,Styles,"If you're that intent on eschewing traditional parental handles, why be cute about it (e.g. ""Transparent's"" Moppa)? Don't you have first names your offspring can call and refer to you by? Or if first names themselves are too gender-specific to suit you, there are always numerals, or ""Hey, you."""
5644,Styles,"There just seems to be no end to people not wanting to conform  even a little bit, not even for their own child's sake."
5645,Styles,"As straight as we are, our adopted son self selected ""Madad"" as his identifier for us. We understood this because we equally showed up to address his needs and to shower him with love. A very astute child."
5646,Styles,"The problem is conflation and irrational process.<br/>IDK how you can teach an adult who thinks (Imagines really) they are an adult and that their education was done well that the very processes their minds use are incorrect and full of holes that create confusion and false ideas like Truth being something that is conditional or subjective. <br/><br/>Of course this cannot possibly harm the children, right?"
5647,Styles,"I wanted my daughter to call me by my first name but she didn't want to!  So, whatever she's comfortable with is fine with me.  I go by mommy, mama or mimi, depending on what she prefers."
5648,Styles,"I have three young children who have always called me by my first name. It's not confusing or difficult for anyone involved. After about one or two interactions teachers, doctors, babysitters, etc. ""get it."" A lot of comments are focused on how there are way more important aspects to parenting than what one goes by. Sure! My trans identity isn't central to the vast majority of the activities involved in the drudgery and joy of parenting. I don't change a diaper like a trans person or do homework help like a trans person. But I have as much right to be called Krys instead of Mom or Dad as someone has to go by Joe instead of Joseph. For some reason the latter is never an issue, but folks suggest I should just ""get used to"" people having a tough time understanding that I just like going by my name. Totally agree with the sentiment that this shouldn't be central to my interactions with others, and even though I live in a remote area, no one seems to care!"
5649,Styles,"From the beginning, we encouraged our two children to call us by our first names.  Easy.  Over time, I became ""Tina"", and my husband was always Nick.  But I noticed that even our most progressive friends found it uncomfortable to hear my children call me by my first name.  I had no idea that such a simple thing was such an act of rebellion.  For us, it is perfectly normal to be a mother and father without a reminder of the hierarchy between a child and a parent and between parent and parent.  That hierarchy can be very restrictive just like the names and labels you write about in this article."
5650,Styles,"I'm glad to call someone by the way they ask me to be called.  And parents can teach their kids to call them whatever they want, and I'll be happy to go along with that.  But please let's not make this a religion, where people who don't ask everyone about their preferred pronoun or tell their kids to call them Baba are somehow regressive biased sinners.  Is this another way in which we divide our society into tribal teams?Language is important, but the spirit behind words is more important.  The goal is a world where everyone treats others in a respectful and loving way, regardless of gender identification.  Changes in language might help in achieving that goal, but aren't the only path and certainly don't guarantee its achievement.  We've been using Ms. for a long time now, but still #MeToo is necessary and we haven't passed the Equal Rights Amendment."
5651,Styles,"The words that we use to describe relationship status carry the baggage of past social assumptions. ""Husband and Wife"", ""Mr. and Mrs."" ""Master and Miss"", imply sexual orientation, gender identity, authority and submission. The evolving acceptance of unions that do not fit these historic descriptors has not yet led to satisfactory new terms, but we should keep trying. ""Husband and Husband, Wife and Wife"" are the commonly used for same sex couples, but are awkwardly echo the historic roles the words embody. ""Housewife"" and ""Househusband"" both confer a subservient, lesser status. Ms. works very well for most females , but what title for the males? What for transgender, cisgender, ambiguous? When I refer to my mate, people think I'm Gay if I say ""Partner"", so I try to refer to her as my ""Spouse"".  Solutions have yet to be found, but language is alive and it will evolve to describe our rich diversity more clearly and more fairly. In the meantime, my Pediatric office has registered childrens' parents as ""Parent1"" and ""Parent 2"" for almost two decades and no family has ever questioned or objected to this neutral usage.  even that simple language may be viewed as burdensome by our single parents, male, female, gay or straight.  "
5652,Styles,"Yes, the article and its premise are ridiculous and not worth running. Frankly, the fact that the sarcasm in my comment wasnât clear shows how overly tuned to sensitivity we are. A bike ride being masculine or feminine, or transitioning between those or being gender neutral? Itâs a bike ride."
5653,Styles,"Brilliantly said. These are the same tourists who used to go to gay bars to feel ""edgy"" and then rush home to do the missionary position for three minutes and fall asleep with Donna Summers pulsating in their dreams. Queer my left foot."
5654,Styles,"Since when are self-indulgent heterosexuals ""queer""? It's an appropriation from people who have experienced real discrimination and abuse for their sexual orientation, up to and including death: gay men and lesbians."
5655,Styles,"A therapist I know once told me that parents who insist on their children calling them by their first names are not fully embracing the parental role. They tend to use that mechanism to put a certain distance between themselves and their responsibility as parental figures. She also said that it doesnât matter what name you have your kids use for you, as long as it is something only they call you (i.e. any derivative of mother/father or something completely different, as long as itâs not just a regular nickname that others also use). "
5656,Styles,A generation ago people freaked out if you used the wrong drinking fountain. 
5657,Styles,"I always thought the nurses did this because they were a) trying to be respectful and b) didnât remember my name. It never insulted me to be called âMom,â even though I am not their mother. If being called âmomâ and âdadâ is upsetting, I just think being a parent may be too complicated for that person."
5658,Styles,"Hear, hear!"
5659,Styles,"Southeast Asians?  What are the terms?  I studied linguists and am curious.  Please share a link.  Thanks.  My point is that infants do say mama and dada.  It is universal.  Show me that Southeast Asian children do not say that as their first sounds.  Also, if you are referring to people as Indians from the United States, they are called Native Americans, and even that term is fraught b/c Native Americans are not a monolith.  They have their own languages among their tribes/communities. "
5660,Styles,My sister is know as Nana to her grandchildren... does this make her a bad grandmother?
5661,Styles,"It wouldn't be a bad thing if the Times and other Better Angels noticed that the often sneered at, sometimes maligned but generally ignored working class is significantly disproportionately non-white."
5662,Styles,"Correct. After reading the article, this Californian has numerous questions as so much was left unsaid. Which is fine as they really aren't that important. After all the hand-wringing, Ms. Davidson settled on ""mama"" and Mx went with ""Abba,"" a nod to his heritage. How conventional. As someone else so aptly pointed out already, this is just another first world problem. Yawn."
5663,Styles,Looking at them I can't tell anything about them.  They look normal but the name business is off the wall.
5664,Styles,"Yes indeed.  Finally some basic common sense vs wishful thinking.  Also can you imagine when the reality of parenting hits with all the layered demands, expectations, and sensitivities hit.  Junior may have we/they ideas ... all sarcasm intended."
5665,Styles,I dunno; tell me why you read the article and commented. Thatâs the answer. 
5666,Styles,Isaac is trans. Not sure how Felix came to be. 
5667,Styles,"@Kim Murphy: Yeah, that's what I was wondering.  On the one hand, it's none of our business, on the other hand, if this couple wanted to keep their relationship private and didn't want strangers wondering about their sex life they didn't have to tell their story to NYT."
5668,Styles,"Itâs hardly private when they put it all out in the NYT.  Judge away, people."
5669,Styles,"Well it's a curiosity, an interesting discussion that doesn't involve Trump (notice this is the first time ""Trump"" has appeared in these comments).  Doesn't actually matter to the rest of us in the slightest,"
5670,Styles,Hilarious.  Nothing at all about sex roles in the Constitution.
5671,Styles,âDadaâ means âbye-byeâ in Indonesian. Whatâs your point? 
5672,Styles,"Thank you very much for the clarification. As a Canadian, many of us are perhaps naturally suspicious of American things. There seems to be so much anger in your country that is challenging for us to understand. Most pleased that you were able to connect with your father. It would appear that something positive came from your search. Well done you! "
5673,Styles,"Same here.<br/>Whatâs more, my boys have know their address, as well both of our cell phone numbers by heart since they were 6. If they get separated from us in a crowd, a cop or a kind soul could connect us pretty quickly."
5674,Styles,"I agree it would have been more poignant/impactful for this story to feature a more visibly queer set of parents. This would have helped more mainstream folks grasp the articleâs points and concepts more readily; sadly, comprehending the nuances of distinguishing gender identity from sex and sexuality and gender presentation is not a forte of the majority. The argument you make here is exactly the type of argument that intolerant people spew when justifying the continued dehumanization of LGBT  folks, and we need pieces that function more effectively (rhetorically speaking) in order to help push the envelope forward. "
5675,Styles,"Keep in mind too that most NYT readers actually find this kind of pushing-the-envelope on social norms thing to be a bit ridiculous.  Of all the people reading this, I guarantee any that are parents are fine with being called mom, dad, and the usual iterations."
5676,Styles,"Itâs such a crazy world, isnât it? I wish folks would just make things easier for you. Itâs be much better if everyone catered to your desires instead of their own! "
5677,Styles,"For some people, fitting into rigid and traditional expectations/rules of what society deems a ""man"" or ""woman"" is complicated. Better to just be free."
5678,Styles,"I don't think my husband calling me his wife is ""baggage"".  Geez."
5679,Styles,Not everybody has to think like you. Jeez. 
5680,Styles,"Don't think it's a question of ""enlightenment.""  Rather, I agree with contemporary Polish philosopher Zbigniew Stawrowski, who coined the phrase ""sleek barbarians"" for today's cultural nihilists who, in the name of their pseudo-""rights"" and alleged victimization, are really victimizing real children who have a right to ""mother"" and ""father.""  But we have long gone beyond the interests of the child to the wants of the contractors (parents must be a loaded term, too).  "
5681,Styles,"I disagree. Our children quickly decide what they call us as soon as they start learning the language. I know a few children who opted to call their parents by their first names. My own daughter, who is currently 5 and bilingual, goes back and forth with ""papa"" and ""dad"", though with her mom she only uses ""mama"", probably because I actively try to teach them both languages and engage in conversations in both much more frequently than my wife does. "
5682,Styles,"Hi John, I get that this specifically isnât some big trend (and I donât really care what people call their parents at all myself), and I meant âphenomenonâ not in the casual sense of âsomething popularâ, but the more scientific sense of âsomething that can observably happenâ.<br/><br/>Iâm mostly responding to people who, yes, feel âtrolledâ, but are reacting and posting things dismissive of transgender people or their pronouns in general and demonstrating a clear lack of familiarity, instead of just responding to this article.<br/><br/>The Times could certainly do a better job of reporting these things, perhaps by focusing this article on people who are more IN PRACTICE gender non-conforming instead of just kind of âfeelingâ that way. Then the new names would make more sense and it might just be a personal interest article. <br/><br/>But still, every time there is an article about gender nonconformance of any sort (even on a level way less than full on âtransgenderâ) in this newspaper, I read a depressing amount of comments slandering or dismissing trans people in general, and this time I just couldnât stop myself from putting at least one sympathetic voice out there while everyone just piles on and essentially dismisses and slanders my community.<br/><br/>Iâm still a young woman who tries to see the best in people, and I donât like to think that many of the readers of this newspaper are all casually a bit hateful towards the trans community, but a lot of the comments on here give me pause."

5685,Washington,"Oh, where to begin?  Trump trusts his ""gut""...again.<br/>How could this be?  He LOOKED the part!<br/>It's not my decision, it's his.<br/>At least I can blame a Democrat.<br/>And, at the end of the day, we see what Trump really thinks about the importance of taking care of veterans.  He had to be forced to pony up a check for them, after bragging that's what he'd do.  Now he'll have to be forced to come up with an actually competent nominee to run the VA."
5686,Washington,"Yet more proof that when GOP says ""privatize"" they really mean use to enrich one of their donors with massive amounts of government funds.  GOP is completely corrupt, in fact Trump-corrupt, the worst corruption of all."

5690,RealEstate,"Sorry to tell you this, but the argumnent in this report is deeply flawed. Most home buyers would tend to be in the age group of millenials (37 or under) because a large share of people above that age group already have a home. It's like saying that the percentage of people attending graduate school is much higher among 30 year olds than among Exers, Younger Boomers, and so forth.  "

Are the exact methods unknown to the Times?  If so, that should be stated outright in the article.  I read it several times thinking I was missing something. "
5696,National,"I'm glad this deadly nut has been caught. That said, the DNA cat is out of the bag. Soon enough all these forensic breakthroughs will remind us all of Alex in Stanley Kubrick's ""A Clockwork Orange."" "
5697,National,"The opening few paragraphs of this article are not exactly crystal clear. It sounds like what they did is take DNA from the crime scenes (which they've had for years) and run it through the online genealogy database. This produced some sort of near or partial match because some relative(s) of the killer uploaded their own DNA for purely genealogical purposes? Is that correct? And then using that information, they looked for male relatives of this person(s) of a certain age living in this area and zeroed in on the suspect. Then they collected his DNA from some place where it had been ""abandoned"" (another commenter says his trash) and got the direct hit they were hoping for. I wish it had been laid out more clearly.<br/><br/>As for the civil liberties concern, I honestly don't understand why anyone would oppose the use of DNA like this. You'd rather let a serial rapist/murderer walk free for the rest of his life than let some cops run a search against your DNA? What if it had been your brother/cousin/uncle? Wouldn't you be *glad* that your own DNA helped put him behind bars. I know I would."
5698,National,This should be a wake-up call to all Americans to never ever voluntarily turn over DNA to a genealogy site.  What an invasion of privacy!
5699,National,"I think it's worth pointing out the unintended consequences of agreeing to make personal DNA profiles public:  Whether you realize it or not, you are possibly agreeing to make access to your family members' DNA  available as well. So much that we as private individuals agree to share ends up impinging upon the privacy of others who have never agreed to have their information made public (FB anyone?) In this case it worked out spectacularly well and has brought to justice a criminal who may have never been caught otherwise. And much credit is due to the investigators and others who insisted on pursuing this 30+ year-old case:  The many victims are absolutely owed this admittedly belated measure of justice, as are all of us who deserve to feel we are safe in a society of laws and civility. But we do need to be reminded from time to time that just as those who enforce the law may take advantage of our online activities to help curb crime and prosecute criminals, those very criminals can also take advantage to use this information against us, and even our family members and friends."
5700,National,It's a DNA site that's use is for genealogy research. Submitting DNA allows families to find each other. It's another way to build your family tree.

Get them away from screens, make them play outside, and read to them at bedtime. "

As judges know how to steer a case, jurors do not, they have no clue when it comes to objective critical thinking and analysis<br/><br/>But in this case the jurors got in right 110%<br/><br/>Cosby is still guilty because he under oath in prior civil litigation admitted to these unlawful actions"
5717,Culture,"It was decades ago, a friend and I had stopped to have lunch at Enrico Banducci's restaurant on North Beach in San Francisco. As we were waiting to be seated I saw Bill Cosby, and nudged my friend and said. ""There's Bill Cosby."" He noticed and motioned us over to join him and Enrico. I was flattered and Cosby was the extremely charming man we all new and loved. He said he was playing that night at the Circle Star and would come back after for Enrico's wonderful apple pie. Then he invited us to his performance and to apple pie after. Somehow I had mentioned my grandmother's superb apple pie and he told me that if, after eating Enrico's, I still thought my grandmother's was better he would come and entertain the elementary school classroom, where I was teaching. My friend and I considered it, but I was visiting San Francisco from my home in the Monterey Bay area and wanted to get home to my husband and young daughter. When I see that episode in light of today.......... Had I been drugged and raped by Bill Cosby, my god, I would hardly have believed it myself. I would have never gone to authorities as I would have known I would not be believed. In those days a woman accusing a man of rape was, herself, the one whose reputation was raked over the coals and destroyed. Fortunately, things are changing. But it makes me sad to think the charming man I had lunch with is not who I always felt he was. Really, Bill Cosby and apple pie! "
5718,Culture,So is Cosby going to now sue her to recover the $3.38 million for breach of contract?
5719,Culture,"Just imagine what a great movie this will make, especially since we Americans can't get enough movies based on Cosby's actions. The courts should rule all proceeds should be given to the victims of his salacious actions."
5720,Culture,"This is justice, except for the fact that he won't see the inside of a prison. He'll be sentenced to house arrest for the rest of his pathetic life. "

5722,Culture,Bill Cosby is innocent!!
5723,Culture,"Quite remarkable really, A claim and counter claim with neither verifiable. Another older man who disappoints us by not being the illusion we created of him. A woman or women making claims at a cultural moment when no woman's claim is cast aside. What is it with us that makes us loath and love celebrity? Cosby as America's dad, my foot. He is a comedic actor about whom we actually knew little. So he proved to be another loathsome man, what a shock. What we do not know and will never know is what happened decades ago. I take no pleasure in seeing him brought down for i never invested in pumping him up.<br/>A passing thought. I wonder when all this will end. I already see men distancing themselves from women. I hear men in the gym saying dating is far to risky ...for a claim against them, made at any time, will run their lives . I have already seen that in my workplace. Claims made, found unverified a year later, and a man's career disassembled. Of course, women must have recourse when mistreated in any way. No one would deny that. But , we have made this a blood sport and that serves us all very poorly."
5724,Culture,I find it incredible in this day and age that several postings blame the women he sexually assaulted. 
5725,Culture,"Shame on you, Bill Cosby.  Your immediate victims paid the highest price.  But you stole something from all of us."
5726,Culture,"I have yet to recall one single prominent black man who has not been falsely accused, maligned, denigrated, bankrupted, killer by this corrupt society.  It is simply implausible for this to be predilection to mere convenience. Harriet Beecher Stowe wrote Uncle Toms Cabin to shock the American consciousness to the utter moral void with which it contents itself.  And in an example of its depravity, even that story of redemption and hope has been bastardized beyond belief. Mr. Cosby who just lost his second child, be strong and of good courage. God is still on the throne and will keep you in all things. I pray for your continued safety. "

5730,Culture,The proof was in the pudding!
5731,Culture,"The admissions of philandering, the admission that he used Quaaludes to ""relax"" women, and now the verdict that he did all to unwilling and unconscious women convinces me that Bill Cosby was the consummate actor. The role he played best? Lovable, funny Bill Cosby. "

May Cosby's victims find comfort and peace, knowing that their sexual attacker has been found guilty<br/>3.

5736,Culture,"When I was a teenager Cosby starred in a TV series with Robert Culp, I Spy. He was the regular guy partner of a professional tennis player who were really spies. It was popular and Cosby had a role that did not depend upon race and did not represent any racial stereotypical behaviors nor themes. Later, his talent as a comedian and writer of humorous takes on various subjects skyrocketed him to fame. Later, he starred in a sitcom about family life that was a big hit. Cosby was very popular as a result of all of this. When his son died tragically most people really felt sad that such a nice person had to suffer such pain.  <br/><br/>His behaviors with women came as a big surprise but the reported stories just seemed too credible to dismiss. His conviction now confirms that this man who was so admired was a bad person who treated innocent people with cruelty to indulge in his fantasies, fantasies that required degrading people. He should be ashamed of himself, but probably is not. "
5737,Culture,"Cosby needn't worry, Trump will pardon then hire him.  Drug czar would be appropriate."

I cannot support him at this point given this type of crime he is now convicted of, but it hurts to see the downfall of someone who otherwise was so entertaining. Sad. And justice for his victims, which is really the only positive thing here. "
5739,Culture,"While it feels like justice is served, the fact that the judge allowed the other accusers to speak to a pattern of criminal behavior felt prejudicial to me. And Cosby's lawyer fell asleep for a full 30 minutes in court the other day. I would think Cosby will appeal."

5741,Culture,"""[A]ll to be accomplished, for me to feel less lonely, all that remained to hope was that ... there should be a huge crowd of spectators and that they should greet me with howls of execration.""<br/><br/>I hope that Mr. Cosby, whether by his choice or by existential accident, may be struck with a sufficient sense of personal responsibility that he can simply say, wow, I did something that is a major violation of the rules in our society, and I will now accept with grace the public indignation and criminal sentence that are now due.<br/><br/>(I do not expect him to take this posture, but if he discovers it, he will have the opportunity to be responsible for everything great and everything awful he has produced, an extraordinary feat.)"

Our black family has alums from Harvard,  Harvard Law, Dartmouth,  Penn, Columbia, Michigan,  and Stanford Law, in addition to a Navy Pilot and two Members of Mensa. With that,  I know other black families that make mine look like a motley crew of underachievers.  <br/><br/>Sorry to disappoint you,  but black achievement has been a reality years before the Cosby Show.

5748,Culture,"Never take pills offered up.  But I am sure drugs and alcohol add to the mix everyday.  The game Cosby played was twisted. What is the next step in that escalation of violence against women?  Is the Canadian who mowed down women with his van so very different.  Worldwide, it is a common practice.  How many stories do we hear of predatory behavior...making a business of refugees.  It is deeply disturbing.  I am glad that Cosby no longer has a self satisfied smirk of winning at his nasty game."
5749,Culture,"I'm glad to pay my share of Cosby's rightful imprisonment, Michael.  And you should be glad to pay yours.  We don't need sex perverts running free any more than we already have.

It's possible that he imagined easy agreements to demands right away, but not likely.

But let's not imagine he thought he could win an actual nuclear battle. What he MAY win is peaceful exchange between the Koreas and perhaps important economic gains in the world - along with assurance that Kim will continue to rule in North Korea for life (or as long as he chooses, and is not assassinated by one of his own).

There was a young couple behind us. They heard us chatting (Iâm sure), and we heard them. When we got to the counter, my wife said, âWeâll split an ice cream. Two spoons, please.â  The guy behind us said, âCâmon! You canât split an ice cream!â I said, âI agree, 100%!â<br/><br/>The long and the short of it: Each couple ended up with TWO ice creams, one for each of us. We chatted, hugged, and said, âSee you.â  Of course, we never saw them again, but we often think about them. We hope they think about us. <br/><br/>My wife says, âThatâs New York for you!â"

The women who endure lewd comments,  those who are subject to work retaliation but cannot afford the enormous cost of legal representation will continue to be victims of both men and the legal system. Are their sufferings of any value to society? Women will fear the blacklist in the time of social media. Who can hire a great lawyer when there are bills to pay? Who can afford to be out of work in a ""right to work"" state during a deposition? One small comment to HR may devastate a career without recourse, and men know this.

Who counsels young adolescent men to teach them right from wrong? Single, celibate clergy? Leaders in Congress? Media? How many men, young and old,  believe that the greater the number of sexual conquests, the better? How many see this as possible abuse? How many fail to see that ""ghosting"" and ""breadcrumbing"" are also forms of mental abuse? None? How many will be exposed to abuse of women in pornography, but watch anyway?

Criminal cases should never be easy to prosecute, that's precisely why the burden is on the accuser, to protect the defendant (and presumed innocent).

Abroad, everyone has affordable health care. Employees have union protections. Vocational training and college tuition is low cost. All families get benefits for children and free pre school.   <br/><br/>This can only work with fair and progressive taxes that tax the super rich adequately. Everyone gets some benefits, but the rich pay higher taxes. <br/><br/>US tax rates are distorted to benefit the rich, which cuts public services for the majority, and lays the burden on the middle class. Then the GOP fans the flames of tax resentment. <br/><br/>Our priorities are creating a class stratified society, with little political cohesion----the opposite of the American dream.<br/>The Gini Index of inequality ranks the US lower than many countries.<br/><br/>We know about Trump/GOP.

5804,Weekend,"The night I saw it, I was a bit distracted by Mr. Washington calling 'line"" four times, and the voice of the stage manager prompting him from the wings.   Yes, it was preview but still but in all my years as a Broadway theater goer, I don't think I've ever witnessed that. I felt like I was attending a rehearsal, not a performance. "
5805,Weekend,"I've not seen this production yet but I have to take serious exception to one of Mr. Brantley's statements in this review.  He references the lies that these characters love to tell and then describes actors themselves as professional liars. This could not be further from the truth and I'm astonished that after so many years as the Times theatre critic Mr. Brantley would characterize (forgive the pun) actors this way.  The primary goal of an actor is to be truthful in imaginary circumstances.  What we are seeking is the truth - the truth of the character we are playing.  We may be pretending for a few hours to be another person, but we are not lying.  We are trying to live that character's truth.  It makes me furious when others describe actors as liars and I'm particularly indignant that Mr. Brantley would choose to represent actors in such a dismissive fashion. "
5806,Weekend,"Had a ticket during the preview run, but the show was cancelled.  Still trying to get over that. I don't live nearby.    Denzel love."
5807,Weekend,I have tickets for next week. It seems to me that Denzel will tear up this part in all the ways described in Ben Brantleyâs review. Denzel - A born Hickey if ever there was one. Canât wait!
5808,Weekend,"It was wonderful to experience a dozen plus male characters on stage being. Iâve seen lots of Broadway shows with lots of performers on stage at once, but the individuality of the men in this show, while sharing the stage and themselves, felt a rare experience to me. And Denzel wasnât the only talent, oh wait, thatâs Bill Irwin and I know that face too, Colm Meany and ... fantastic, talented, casting. The ending made me laugh, which was surprising and wonderful. It was one of the most satisfying endings I have experienced in live theater and the lighting was spectacular too! So glad I absorbed this production. Well done, gentlemen!"
5809,Weekend,"âthere are three intermissions, all of them short. Ten minutes after Act I, then a quick stretch after Act II, then ten minutes after Act III.â<br/><br/>From most of the 45th Street theatres, as long as itâs not raining, the bathrooms in the Marquis Hotel are a decent option with the escalator directly up to the Marquis Theatre level.  Maybe since the hotel has a theater, Iâve never been stopped and asked what Iâm doing there; and as long as it doesnât conflict with intermission at the show there, thereâs never been any waiting at the bathroom. <br/><br/>Regarding standing room at the Jacobs (formerly Royale) â I remember standing room spots at âGreaseâ were spacious and $3.   The people standing next to me had done standing room about 20 times. (That means they saw âGreaseâ 20 times for $60, no facility fee, back then!)  "
5810,Weekend,"Great tip, but you'd have to move pretty darn fast to get back in time.  <br/><br/>Bathrooms at the Jacobs were not hard to use before the play started.  I think the reality only sunk in for most people after Act I.  And of course they have several bars in the theater.  Which is appropriate!"
5811,Weekend,A standing ovation does not mean a whole lot these days...you canât avoid them no matter how pedestrian the production. I did dig this show...just wasnât blown away by it.
5812,Weekend,"It was exciting to be there, before the reviews, before every last bit of business had been worked out.<br/><br/>I'm still trying to figure out Washington's body language at the very end--I felt like his Hickey knows he isn't crazy, but is going to pretend he is.  He's actually not ready to die--still got a few pipe dreams left.  Morse's Slade is another matter.  "
5813,Weekend,"Funny that every time I see an actor in a television commercial selling pharmaceuticals, insurance, booze, colognes, cars et al. I can't help but agree with Mr. Brantley."
5814,Weekend,Agreed. Anyone know if the Nathan Lane production was recorded?
5815,Weekend,"Ryan also was terrific in the 1971 production of ""Long Day's Journey."""
5816,Weekend,"Agreed.  Robert Ryan was superb.  It was also Frederick March's last performance, I believeâalso superb and subtle!  And I can't talk about the film without mentioning Bradford Dillman's dynamic performance as Willy Obanâa knockout!  Unfortunately, the film falls apart with Hickey's monologue, and I was told it was because Lee Marvin hadn't memorized his lines.  Frankenheimer wanted to shoot it in one shot, but he couldn't.  I also read that this was the film where Jeff Bridges, who played Don Parritt, decided he had to get serious about acting.  It's definitely worth a look.  "
5817,Washington,"Mitch McConnell's name does not appear on this list, nevertheless his name will only grow in infamy, as history looks back upon this disastrous period. McConnell made his name as the Speaker of the Senate who vowed to make Barack Obama a one term president. He failed in this endeavor but became the leading enemy of everything Obama proposed, including blocking the President's candidate to the Supreme Court. With Trump he simply bobs and weaves his silent assent to all the Presidents racial insults attempting a neutrality that only magnifies his complicity.<br/><br/>and all."
5818,Culture,"The trial as was the first was a sham! An over zealous prosecutor once again manipulating the system to get  his way. Constanza took over 3 million to drop the case. Proceedings were sealed. That should have been end of story. Three days before statute of limitations expired he was allowed to reopen case. Never should have happened. First trial ended in a mistrial despite the quite ridiculous ""testimony"" from a woman who had no bearing on the case at hand. That didn't work so the same judge allowed the testimony of 5 women none of who had any bearing on the charges. Hearsay. No evidence. No previous charges (which I thought was inadmissable any way). Judge allowed ""witness"" to speak directly to defendant in front of jury, (which should have ended trial right then). In the American Judicial System sometimes guilty people do go free when the rules of evidence are not followed. In this sham the rules of evidence were thrown out. No evidence linking to any crime. Think about this; all of these men being released from prison after serving decades of their lives for crimes (most often rape) they did not committ but were no where the scene. Yet the victims swore that they were raped by quite innocent defendants. Think about this; the crux of the Stormy Daniels situation is that if she took money to remain silent then she should not be able to speak about the case. "
5819,Culture,"We need to stop holding up Celebrities as role models. Period. We have become a nation obsessed with them, including now our POTUS. Remember, most are really good at acting. That is their chosen career! <br/><br/>There are so many important role models out there: teachers, scientists, your grandmother, the kid with learning disabilities bagging your groceries (who, by the way, you ignore while you are looking at People Magazine in the check-out aisle reading about celebrities!) And the media needs to stop elevating the celebrity nonsense as well. How about some articles highlighting real everyday heroes and thinkers? "

Anyone who knows anything about the Scandals could almost....ALMOST say that Dan Enright has nothing on Bill Cosby. "
5822,Culture,"Journalist Ronan Farrow distanced himself from his show business family and won a Pulitzer Prize in the process of exposing predators like Harvey Weinstein, who one day soon may share a jail cell with Bill Cosby. It's time to take Ronan's cue, Mr. Morris, and do your job. To quote Nina Simone (who quoted Langston Hughes) ""Make sure you tell them exactly where it's at so they have no place to hide.' Allict the comfortable and comfort the afflicted, Mr. Morris. And stop lamenting about your lost youth."

5825,Culture,"Two uses of vertiginous in one column is two too many. Feels like trying too hard.<br/><br/>As for the content: Yeah, people on television and in movies aren't usually like that in real life, from Ricky and Lucy Ricardo through Ralph and Alice Kramden and Cliff and Claire Huxtable.  That's okay, if they make us more tolerant of a (mildly) mixed race couple in 1952, or more attracted to an African American family in the 1980s, that's mission accomplished. The real people rise and fall on their actions independent of the idealized vision they created for the rest of us.  "
5826,Culture,Don't forget that Cliff Huxtable was a gynecologist. I always thought that was an odd choice for the dad in a family show. Now I think that it was almost certainly either a sick joke on Cosby's part or at least a revealing look into his psyche.
5827,Culture,"Well, Cosby, after all, was an actor. Even in his comedy routines, he was playing a part. <br/><br/>I adored Alexander Scott, and I thought Cliff Huxtable was the neighbor I'd most like to be friends with, and like everyone else I thought Bill Cosby was just like them. I'm as sad and disillusioned as everyone else to find it's not so, but I feel that I have only myself to blame: What made me think an actor would be anything like the roles he played? My disappointment is one thing Cosby isn't responsible for."
5828,Culture,"Cosby's crime was so much greater than betraying Cliff Huxtable.  Before that he was the first Black leading man on TV, in I Spy with Robert Culp.  Their interracial buddy routine was a huge influence on everyone, long before The Cosby Show.  Before that, in the early 1960s Cosby's record albums were hugely popular with young people, Black humor that was palatable for everyone.  Cosby let everyone down.  "
5829,Culture,"Cosby and OJ Simpson always reminded me of each other. They were athletic and good looking guys who happened to be Black, but who seemed perfectly fit into a very White world.<br/><br/>You'd see them on tv and, OJ, in movies. You didn't see them as representing any type of Black culture, or MLK leadership qualities. <br/><br/>They were the guys about whom White folks might say, ""Oh, I have a Black friend"" because these were well, you know, White like Black guys. <br/><br/>Their acceptance into the world of whiteness, in retrospect, is kind of weird. They were more or less subsumed. Look - here's a couple of Black guys who aren't ""scary."" You can like them! The marketing machine made them ""safe.""<br/><br/>Look how that turned out. "

Do not fool yourself into thinking this is anything but victim-blaming, and anything but unacceptable. Do you also blame children who talk to strangers? Women who go on dates? Men in prison? "
5834,Culture,"All people must pick a lane, not just women. Seeing a woman as this or that, but not seeing men that way is one the big roadblocks to womenâs success. <br/><br/>Further, I think we need to rennet the lane changers.

5842,Politics,Maybe one of the Trump family members wanted the job. Don Jr.? Does it require a security clearance? How about Jared Kushner?
5843,Politics,"Ryan's not giving a reason for the chaplain's dismissal leaves a cloud over Father Conroy's reputation.  Unconscionable behavior.  The Trumpian code of unethical behavior is spreading like slime that slithers through the halls of the Republican-held Congress.  Too bad it triggers the bad old days of anti-Catholicism  with Rep.

Guess that Trump forgot that his first two years of college were at Fordham, also run by those Jesuits whom Ryan and the Congressional Republicans seemingly disdain.  "

5850,Games,"Hah! for how a Steinberg ENTRANCE can ENTRANCE! At the solve wrapped up, I could SEE THINGS, but almost doubted if I was  SEETHING or TEETHING.

That's just to show I CAN TAKE A HINT, and DS always lEAVEs a little something to run with.<br/><br/>Terrific NW and SE corners, as well as all the long'uns.  Sly to  hide away the STONER TRIP, and I appreciated being reminded: ODETTA at the Gate of Horn was one of the first LPs I ever bought. Sometimes, however, young Steinberg almost LOSES LEaP OVER entries like PATNESS, which is low on aptness, and bij all rights ought to  be reserved for the rare occasions ""His Royal PATNESS"" comes in useful.<br/><br/>Off on a slight tangent, I just wondered How Much GELT Can a PARIAH Carry? (Apparently, many millions, per Wiki) Which led to wondering whether RiA would think of a musical link to ""They Call the Wind Pariah""?  Anyone here  bij chance remember a posting years ago with *all* the lyrics to ""They Call the Wind  MO RiA""?<br/><br/>So thanks for the memories, Mr Steinberg, and for a delightful Friday 39:13."

5861,Culture,"In the mid-'90s I lived in Paris for three years and I had the opportunity to visit several museums. Smartphones, selfies, instagram and so on were just unknown  words. During that period I saw the Mona Lisa three times  and I remember that every time I tried to memorize the actual colors, dimensions, proportions and expression of that masterpiece, building up an emotion worth more than a million of selfies. Today we think that a smartphone can even store an emotion just like a selfie or a phone number. In my opinion this distraction is killing the deep emotion  that links us to a masterpiece. "
5862,Culture,"As Andy Warhol so poetically expressed it in 1962 with his 32 Campbell's Soup paintings, art is a commodity to be consumed. Taking your own picture of the Mona Lisa is like getting it at a discount and being able to take it home with you. You really can have your cake and eat it too. Or so it seems to some.<br/><br/>That the experience of the 2"" screen version pales to complete insignificance compared to the real thing, now unfortunately behind glass, reveals the degree to which people are ignorant of the kinds of profound experiences great art is capable of giving them.<br/><br/>Fortunately there is a lot of great (and blessedly not so famous) art in other museums that the herd knows nothing about. I never pass through London without stopping at Kenwood House and meditating on Vermeer's ""The Guitar Player"", a painting of seemingly infinite depth and meaning. Invariably I have the room entirely to myself. <br/><br/>Another favorite London stop, the Wallace Collection to see Fragonard's The Swing, a work that reveals the essential animal nature of humanity, so pleasantly hidden beneath ""culture""."
5863,Culture,"The critique should be directed at the generation that lives life as a spectator sport rather than as engagement. They are the generation that ""deep dives"" to become engaged, as though living fully was a heroic act. They're to be pitied, rather than lauded for the number of likes on their Instagram posts."
5864,Culture,"I was at the Louvre last summer and shared similar feelings. The Mona Lisa, small in size, shares a room with works of art that are far more impressive in scenery and scope. <br/><br/>You meander through scores of other works, masterpieces in their own right, to finally land upon a painting that is as recognizable and familiar as the McDonalds logo. I suppose this phenomenon is propagated in this day and age by the smartphone and social media, but the Mona Lisa has carried this mystique for generations. Seeing it in person, or even on a four-inch smartphone screen, has and always will be a shared global experience. "
5865,Culture,"In case you read the article, it's not the 'next' generation, it's everyone...the 'next' gen isn't in their 50's and balding...have another look at the photo.<br/>On the lighter side, a 'selfie stick' could double up as a walking aid."
5866,Culture,"I hate to ban the photos altogether, but having recently revisited the Louvre and other museums in Europe I encountered the same problem: people taking photos/selfies and not really even seeing the paintings. It seemed to me the majority of these photographers were putting a check on their bucket list items. Very annoying. But like others I was encouraged to spend more time enjoying other less well-known paintings."

That said, there's a good chance that this will not be successful (just as there's a good chance that isolation and indirect negotiations would not be successful).<br/><br/>Getting to sit down with the US directly is a concession by the US relative to our past position, though, so it's foolish that Trump is declaring victory for that. This has been a longstanding North Korean goal. He's going to look like an idiot when Kim says that by ""denuclearization,"" he means the US removing its nuclear forces from Asia. Or when he agrees to a bunch of stuff and then tests nuclear weapons six months later."
5869,Foreign,"As a Korean citizen, it was hard not to see all symbolism and the stagecraft as the article mentions. Perhaps this is what the two Korean leaders needed to shift gears so that the seeds of peace and hope can be planted after all these years.

5871,Foreign,"Trump's inexperience, insecurities, and impatience for quick results will fatefully collide soon with Kim's cunning, superior political skills, and necessity for slow-walking any negotiations to preserve his nuclear weaponry. His overtures of normalization, cooperation, and reducing tensions with the South was a brilliant, pre-Summit tactic. This growing positive relationship creates both a buffer against Trump's expected pressure upon Kim to conform to his impetuous wishes and a wedge in U.S.-South Korean relations if that much desired relationship is threatened by Trump's imperious demands upon the North. Three dimensional chess vs. a game of checkers."
5872,Foreign,"Good news for the peace process in Korea; now NK is a member of the ""nuclear club"" and the USA is out of the game...<br/>Anyway, it may be better that way; anyone but Trump!<br/>Next step for Xi will be the reunification of Taiwan and confirmation of the Chinese dominance over China Sea and South Pacific.<br/>Japan will have to get nuclear weapons soon...!"

The last time Japan flexed their muscles  in order to try to dominate the area was not good for anyone. Present attitudes can change but even so an emerging powerful militant Japan doesn't seem to make sense; but with Trump involved, anything can happen. Today the power of China could/would/should offset any more attempts at an "" East Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere"", by any asian nation, especially Japan unless of course it is China. Naturally China seems to be the natural heir to any possible asian leadership vacuum that Trump may be inadvertantly surrendering/creating in the area due to his strange handling of N.

We are not machines though the modern civilization tries to turn us into them. <br/><br/>Rest and rejuvenation is not making hectic plans and going out on an event filled vacation. It is just doing nothing and spacing out. My minds needs space to keep pace with the external changes in our life. We all have this inner life that need to be in sync with the external. <br/><br/>When we do not let our minds and bodies rest and heal we invite a low quality life. A lot of people think multi tasking will help and will never be able to provide complete rest to their bodies and minds. We are not talking about charity or people doing something for the world...we are talking about people not being generous with their own minds, bodies and feelings. What they can do for the world outside is really debatable. <br/><br/>Depression and lack of enthusiasm is a direct result of a life of constant busyness to pay bills. Ninety percent of the people if I am not wrong live just to pay bills. And that is really miserable. One should break up life goals into small achievable targets and after reaching each small target should be followed with a period of rest. Rest should mean really rest and not just some fad. <br/><br/>There is a much bigger root issue we face behind all this. This is the attitude of compromise and not doing anything fully.

Without significant wage increases that's just not going to happen. Republicans have sold a bill of goods to the entire country and it will only become more obvious as the calendar ticks along. "
5902,National,"Part of the problem is the lack of resources for child welfare agencies across the country. For example, due to lack of funds, there was a hiring freeze in Oregon. A new child welfare caseworker could be hired only after 6 caseworkers had left. So not only were they managing unlawful numbers of cases, but a subpar caseworker (a generous description in some cases) had job security - their dismissal would mean distribution of their cases to already overloaded caseworkers. <br/><br/>The issues in-our child welfare system do not get appropriate attention - these are the left-behind children; no one wants to fund their safety. NOT MY TAX DOLLARS! Itâs disgraceful and these horror stories are not unpredictable. "
5903,National,"I know there are many families who adopt or foster across races, and I believe many of these are good parents with good intentions.  I can understand large adopted families if the couple is adopting many related siblings, But when a white couple adopts 6 black children, all otherwise unrelated, doesn't this give pause? Adopting 6 black children seems less like genuine concern and more like amassing a collection of novelties."
5904,National,"I see it often reported that this family ""looked normal"" and thats why this abuse went on unaddressed for so long. It also seems like these parents often spoke about how their children were troubled and mentally incapacitated and under their care they were improving. I am reminded of a news story of a women who had her child get help because she was going in labor and she had her child taken away. That woman was black. And these women, both white, were reported multiple times and no one ever considered taking the children from the home. <br/><br/>I do not mean to be inflammatory, but as a black woman, I can't help but see race underlining situations such as these ones, and how the words of these black children fell on deaf ears. Racial disparity in child welfare cases has been long documented. And even when black children are removed from troubling situations, they are more likely to moved more often than their white counterparts. Abuse is not something that only happens in ""shady"" low income neighborhoods.  Abuse occurs in every class but I feel there sometimes can be a reluctance to acknowledge it in the middle and upper classes. <br/><br/>Growing up, sometimes we did not have enough to eat. But if my parents could have provided food they would have. They did not, as in this situation, cruelly withhold it. These women positioned themselves as saviors of these children while they terrorized them. They ""looked normal"" till it was too late. "
5905,National,"You must be joking, correct? <br/><br/>In case you aren't--perhaps you didn't read the article? (so many people don't before commenting) <br/><br/>These kids were not described as misbehaving in any of the ways you mention. The weren't allowed to speak without raising their hand. They were so starved and malnourished they appeared years younger than their actual ages. They were beaten, and they were terrified.<br/><br/>These weren't overwhelmed parents perhaps a tad overzealous in their discipline--these women had serious mental &amp; emotional problems, and they were physically and mentally abusing these children for years. And then they murdered them.<br/><br/>This story isn't about disciplining a misbehaving child."
5906,National,Money. These people are paid for taking in the children. These women made 2K a month as supplemental income by fostering the kids according to the article. Some are good hearted when they do so; these two were not. I want to know about their parents and their background - have seen nothing of that yet. Who parented these psychopaths? What was their context that got them to murder their children?

Six teenagers will eat as much or more than any adult. So the food budget for eight people would be enormous. I've raised teens -- they can chug a half gallon of expensive orange juice in 10 minutes. And the two adults here look very well nourished and not thin or underfed AT ALL -- so the two moms ate heartily and then let their kids go hungry. The neighbors said they thought the 16 year old daughter was SEVEN, because she was so tiny and thin.  "
5909,National,@priceofcivilzation: Not a good solution. We live in an economy that requires employees to pull up roots and follow their jobs. My parents moved seven times before I was twelve.

Macron played Trump like a cheap violin, and much more subtly than Putin, or even Xi of China.<br/><br/>After all, Macron has something Trump never will have:  An adviser totally loyal to him who is shrewd, observant, never misses anything, and whom he can rely on totally. That would be his wife, Mme. Macron.  While never betraying it for a second, it was blatantly obvious she totally saw through Trump, his ego, his brainlessness, his misogyny, and how to play off it, and have her husband play off it.<br/><br/>It's clear to anyone who looks (and here I must disagree with Mr. Cohen) that the reason May and Merkel fail with Trump where Macron succeeds is blindingly obvious: He's male, they are female and, no matter WHAT he says, Donald Trump is totally incapable of seeing ANY woman as his equal. Brigitte made sure Emmanuel knew that and used that. Since THEIR relationship is in a different universe than Trump's and Melania's, Trump would never realize that.<br/><br/>Finally, to reassure Europe and France that Macron is not Trump's poodle, there was his brilliant speech to Congress, which got both Dems and the GOP standing up at times, followed by his brilliant pre-departure press comments.<br/><br/>Macron is not perfect, but France definitely got the better, smarter ""brother"" in this ""bromance"""

5921,Washington,"There is a bit of poetic justice here.  The Russians broke into the DNC to steal e-mails that they forwarded to their asset, Wikileaks, so that selected excerpts could be published at strategic moments to discredit the Clinton campaign.  Now, The Russians have been hoisted on their own petard, as Natalya Veselnitskaya, who claimed she was just a private attorney, had her own e-mails are leaked in turn, showing that she was working as an agent of the Russian Procuracy.  The thing is, this is not new. We all knew that Veselnitskaya was working for the Procuracy, and by extension the Kremlin, and was intimately involved in the effort to erase Magnitsky Act sanctions against Russia.  What is new is that we now have stand up in court proof that has ""providentially"" emerged just at the right moment, a la Wikileaks, coming just after the release of the Republican House Intelligence report claiming there was no collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia.  This conclusion by the Republicans was, of course, achieved only by studiously ignoring all evidence to the contrary.  In particular, the Republicans blocked all efforts to  call witnesses to the Trump Tower meeting, where Veselnitskaya tried to recruit Trump, Jr., Kushner and Manafort into the effort to do away with the Magnitsky Act.  As for Veselnitskaya, she will likely find it impossible to continue her ""private"" campaign to do away with Russia sanctions.  Sounds like it's time for an interview with Bob Mueller instead."

5923,Washington,"Natalia Veselnitskaya is a private attorney who runs her own law firm. Using documents supplied by Russiaâs prosecutor general to defend her clients in the Prevezon case doesnât make her a Kremlin operative. She knew that the prosecutor generalâs office had convicted the U.S. Justice Departmentâs primary witness in the Prevezon caseâAmerican-born financier David Browderâof tax evasion and did what any defense lawyer would have done. She used the documents from the tax evasion case to discredit the Justice Departmentâs witness.<br/>But we now know that Fusion GPSâthe firm the Hillary Clinton campaign paid to produce the Steele Dossierâmay have provided the documents that Veselnitskaya offered Donald Trump Jr. at the Trump Tower meeting. Veselnitskaya hired Fusion GPS to conduct investigative work on the Prevezon case.  Fusion GPS founder Glynn Simpson testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee that he had dinner with Veselnitskaya the night before the Trump Tower meeting and lunch with her the day of the Trump Tower meeting. He testified documents he gave to Veselnitskaya regarding the Prevezon case may have been the same documents she showed to Trump Jr. at Trump Tower.  He said,â I read she wanted to give them some information and I wondered whether it was information from the Prevezon case and I've seen speculation to that effect, but I  don't have any knowledge.â  "

Israel HAD to win that war to survive. and just like in any military conflict, there were refugees. dealing with the refugee issue is a big problem and Israel is not the only culprit . suffice it to say : if the Palestinians FINALLY find a leader ( like the jews had ben gurion )who could have a realistic, constructive and positive( read the Palestinian charters ! ) - their refugee problem might inch closer to a resolution.<br/>these "" peaceful"" demonstrations can't do it, and they're not intended to."
5948,Foreign,"This comment ignores that the Palestinians were offered the ability to negotiate sales of their lands. That many would not wish to submit to forced sales is understandable but the vast majority were advised by Jordan, Syria, and Egypt not to sell as these nations promised to destroy Israel. I.e. the problems, here, are extremely complex.  The âright of returnâ is further muddied by many other factors that make âright of returnâ a non viable proposal.  The bitter, harsh reality is that, for a number of irreversible reasons, the Palestinians will not be able to return. It is way, way past time for that reality to sink in and for the Palestinians to abandon the desire to wipe Israel off the map. The potential future for Palestinians who rise up and throw off corrupt leadership and choose peaceful, unarmed co-existence is that Israel and the West would absolutely love to assist them in becoming a prosperous and progressive people.

5965,OpEd,"Of course, all this hides the real question: why does the House even need a chaplain?  And the question I'd ask instead is this: what does it cost to have him there...and can we do without him?  <br/><br/>And how rich that the Liberals are  up in arms over the firing...most of them are atheists anyway--and look down on people of faith with utter disdain.

5975,Politics,"Both sides make up facts -- and that's a fact!<br/><br/>Take global warming, for example -- a third-rail issue if ever there was one.<br/><br/>To ""test"" denials that global warming has occurred, I checked official records of average San Francisco temperatures when I moved here over 40 years ago (once every hour -- yes, somebody actually measure this and records it!), and again in 2015. I learned that the average temperature had risen by 6 degrees in those 40+ years, a rise I consider significant.<br/><br/>Global-warming deniers deny this, but how can one deny measured data? So chalk that one up as a loss for global-warming deniers.<br/><br/>But I learned that the other side also misstates facts. <br/><br/>Global warming has one certain consequence -- the globe is warmer -- but other consequences typically are predicted, especially sea level rise. That has not happened here. I wasn't sure, though I walk along the SF shore often and have never noticed it. And so, once again, I checked actual measurements. Turns out that sea level is a composite measurement: the ""net"" of water level rise (or fall) and land level rise (or fall). That explains why sea level rises 1.91 mm a year here in SF (and has been for many years, without any recent acceleration), while sea level rises only 0.64 mm a year just across the Bay Bridge in Alameda. (Figures for Los Angeles and New York are .88 mm per year (LA) and 2.72 mm  per year (NYC)). In a few spots in Oregon, and in nearly all of Alaska, sea level is falling."
5976,Politics,I am most angered at the complicit congress for seating a cabinet and federal judges who are all committed to the dismemberment of our institutions and laws that are there to protect the weakest among us.

We have only seven more months until the midterms. Let's make the Congress solidly Progressive. Let's win a veto-proof Congress in November!!"
5983,Politics,"Trump grasp the threats to the party?? What on earth is wrong with the Republicans? Trump cares for nobody but himself, he sees nobody but himself, all things must be a mirror for Trump, all things must reflect Trump. His out-sized ego and severe Narcissistic Personality Disorder will allow nothing else. <br/><br/>It is clear that Trump has no loyalty to anyone but Trump, he's like a Don, demanding obsequious loyalty from all, but he gives nothing in return. Everyone around the world can see that, why do Republicans refuse to?"
5984,Politics,"How long will it be before Republicans realize that Trump's ONLY allegiance is to himself?<br/><br/>Other than a tax-cut for himself, he ignores traditional Republican Trade-Policies and his adherence to Social-Issues is mere lip-service to please the most voters he believes he can get. If the Dem's take one or both Houses this fall he'll be singing like a Democrat the remainer of his term!"
5985,Politics,"The Republicans hold gerrymandered districts from their brilliant and prescient state-level national strategy after the 2010 census to conquer and own congress for many many years following.  The only way to overcome them will be if large supermajorities shift well beyond their actual partisan distributions.  Republicans retiring are correctly seeing the longevity of this situation and an extremely lucrative future monetizing as lobbyists and executives their connections and during-office lobby-grafting concessions to their current and future business partners, they see it existing for some time to come, at the very least through 2020, and plan on making the most of it."

"
5987,Politics,"While I'd like to be confident Trump's Republican enablers will be swept from Congress, I'm not. There will be full-on voter suppression in current Republican-controlled states, significantly more egregious that what we've ever seen before. And, you can bet the Russians will be going all out to hack voter rolls and voting machines, especially since Trump and his cabal have been actively dissuading US intelligence and the FBI from doing anything about it.<br/><br/>It's both terrifying and profoundly saddening to know that so many Republican politicians, and the Americans who support them, evidently could care less about our democracy, and would, it seems, gleefully celebrate if our democracy and its core principles were undermined to the point where the US became a de facto puppet state of Putin and the Kochs and their ilk."
5988,Politics,"When Republican members of Congress, fearful of what's coming in the Fall, say  they want to neutralize or bring trump into line, they are only attacking their party's messenger. They should try rethinking and updating some of their terrible policies. They should apologize to the nation for enabling this catastrophic presidency. And then they could try neutralizing some of the most terrible members among them, starting with Nunes and Cruz. Once they do that, they will still lose, but it's a start. "
5989,Politics,"TRUMP IS the culmination of years of bad behavior and worse government by the GOPpers.  He is uniquely unsuited to public life, as well as to his extremely limited ability to change his attitude toward life.  Since childhood, Trump has viewed life as big food fight.  As a kid, when invited to birthday parties, he'd start food fights.  Kids do not spontaneously engage in such behavior.  In 1924, his father was arrested after a KKK rally for fighting with the police.  Such violent behavior, exhibited in public, such as attacking police officers, does not stop at the front door.  It is highly likely that Trump's father was violent with the family.  Having been exposed to domestic violence, he learned to take what he wanted by force.  His demented mentor, Roy Cohn, a notorious, debarred attorney, was Joe McCarthy's attack dog during the with hunts of the 40's and 50's, based on trumped (pun intended) up evidence fabricated by J. Edgar Hoover, three of the most evil men in the mid 20th century US.  Trump has continued his brutality, disgracing himself and profoundly diminishing the office he incompetently holds as well as the standing of the US worldwide.  He, along with the GOPpers are going to be swept away in a historic landslide in November of 2018.  The GOPpers are engaged in a civil war, the results of which will be the breaking of its stranglehold ideology on the US.  At the end of the day, the GOP will have received the comeuppance it has so richly deserved for so long."

President Trump is still popular among the voters according to recent polls and hopefully this will transfer over to the midterm elections.  He needs to stay on course and not neglect his base.  He does not want to be a one term president and knows a lot rides on the upcoming results.  He needs to listen to his party and not swerve too far afield from the party leadership.  He also is aware that in order to pass more bills the Republicans must stay in power.  This will be the ultimate test of his leadership.

6032,OpEd,"Professor Effron might be right but we're a long long way from truly understanding how the mind works. Regardless, I find any notion that some physical-psycho-sociological explanation that takes human choice out of the equation abhorrent. To paraphrase Charlton Heston, you're going to have to pry free will out my cold dead hands!<br/><br/>I happen to believe in good and evil, order and chaos, in a very Platonic way as resonances or forms upon which we scaffold our lives and reputations. Who we are is a direct reflection of our actions, which in turn are predicated on our willingness to take the far more difficult path of doing good versus falling back into the darkness of sloth and narcissism.  <br/><br/>For good reasons archetypes exist which we can and should use to judge ourselves and others, and one of the best reasons is because the archetype provides an exit from the often infinite relativism the world so often seems to present to us.<br/><br/>For Trump, I have an archetype in mind, not to explain his behavior, but to guide mine."
6033,OpEd,"Unfortunately, the study did not break down whether Clinton supporters were as likely as Trump supporters to engage in this sort of mental justification.

"
6034,OpEd,"You're right, he does deliver.  A very short list that I can come up with in five minutes: (1) Tax cuts that will blow up the national debt while directly benefiting only already-wealthy Americans in any significant way; (2) the ludicrously unqualified and self-serving Cabinet members he has appointed -- meaning nearly all of them -- and the damage that has been/will be done re levels of pollution, public schools, consumer protection, etc., (3) a marked uptick in international disrespect among our allies based on widespread international comments re the disruption of the Paris &amp; trans-Pacific obligations, the ludicrous number of demonstrable administration falsehoods, the perception that the country being run by FOX-instilled tweets and that the man's mind has unsettling similarities to a weather vane, etc.<br/><br/>Perhaps one of his most significant ""deliveries"" is the exposure of a minority of Americans of their stubborn adherence to the idea that putting America First means sticking it to Democrats, ridiculing higher education and the positions/opinions of others unlike themselves (especially europeans or others from different cultures) and otherwise blaming anyone or anything other than themselves for their being treated ""unfairly"" (the redefining of which would be another of his deliveries).

Assuming that you're like most people in the world and think that a nuclear North Korea is dangerous, then you should be happy if this is true.  On the other hand, it seems clear that so many things our government does never really is delivered as advertised.  So, maybe Trump can buffoon his way into a peace agreement.  Or maybe it'll be a little more like the tax plan:  not much in the way of peace, but a whole lot in the way of gifts to business interests.

6039,Editorial,"The legitimacy of the courts, especially the Supreme Court, has eroded, but the Times conveniently ignores the roots of this erosion, probably because of the role the Times has played in encouraging it.  It was the Democrats, fully supported by the Times, who made Bork a verb, after telling us for years that a judgeâs philosophy should not matter, only his or her credentials.  Then the Democrats, supported by the Times, conducted the first partisan filibuster to prevent a judicial appointment, which was against a Miguel Estrada, a conservative Hispanic.  Then the Democrats, encouraged by the Times, made the partisan filibuster a standard procedure for preventing judicial appointments by President George W. Bush.  Then when Republicans adopted the tactic of the judicial filibuster pioneered by the Democrats, the Democrats changed the rules of the filibuster in the middle of a legislative term by a simple majority vote.  While the Times rings its hands over the Republicans ending the filibuster for Supreme Court nominees, the editorial board supported the Democrats ending it for other judicial nominees.  What this history makes clear is that the Times cares not a whit for the integrity of the courts as institutions that should be afforded some insulation from politics and ideology.  They only care about making the court as liberal as possible, which is their right, but please spare us the crocodile tears for the Courtâs legitimacy."

6042,Editorial,"What a silly editorial. It's almost juvenile. <br/><br/>No one knows what's going to happen today, tomorrow, or next week. Two justices could die either in their sleep or in an accident. <br/><br/>Both would have to be replaced, wouldn't they? <br/><br/>This all goes back to the Democrats, who can not accept the poor choice they made by selecting Mrs. Clinton to run in 2016 largely because it was ""her turn."" You sow what you reap."
6043,Editorial,"To someone from outside the US, this article merely confirms that the Court is a hopelessly political one.  The only reason you want Kennedy to stay is so that he can give you the outcomes you want!   Perhaps a conservative appointment will help return the Court to its rightful place: deciding disputes according to law.  "
6044,Editorial,"Please stay, Justice Kennedy, some of us murmur, as if you were leaving The Gates of Troy, but perhaps it is about taking hope away with you for our Country if you were to leave now.  We have lost our sense of direction and policy of governance in these troubled times afflicting our Nation. <br/><br/>'Devastated' is a word that comes to mind when thinking of a Great American.  Her family was a conservative one; and representative of the hard work and values that it takes to be a staunch believer in our Constitution.  Kennedy was her last name, and she would have been eighty this coming May.  She would have been in disbelief over our current State of Affairs, and she knew her history.<br/><br/>There are few Americans left with your power and honesty to do Right for The People, and as I write in sorrow, Mother Nature joins in a torrent of rain."
6045,Editorial,"""I would think Ginsburg....would be next to retire.""  Do you remember what the right wing god Charlton Heston said about his gun?

6046,Editorial,Merrick Garland was not an ideologue. Samuel Alito is.  Kennedy is not. We need balance rather than feudalism. The Neil Gorsuch appointment was a travesty of  justice.

6047,OpEd,"A boor is still a boor, no matter if your name is Trump or Knoll. Singing your own praises? I don't care who does it or how they do it, it's revolting. JK Rowling was a gigantic success without the  excessive ego display. People like her get my respect and admiration.  Self promoters like you, Ms Knoll? Where's my air flight bag. "
6048,OpEd,"Because you're a woman, blind ambition is supposed to be less nauseating. Got it. Don't agree with it. <br/><br/>Congrats on being a success so far.  I have no doubt you are  fully capable of achieving your aims.  Then you can attend great parties in Beverly Hills or the Hamptons with other cultural luminaries who share your values. Say hi to Martin Skreli, Donald Trump, 50 Cent, Kim Kardashian, Stephen Cohen, Bill Ackman, Betsy Devos, Dimon, Henry Paulson, Steve Mnuchin, Pruitt, Martha Stewart, Darren Aronovsky, and that little twit speaker of the house, whose name, thank the gods, I have forgotten for the moment. I cannot even imagine how much fun you are going to have with all those other equally charming people, discussing the important work you all do.<br/><br/>But, yeah, exploiting people will probably make you feel better than the poor feel while being exploited. What a world. What a jerk."
6049,OpEd,"I read Ms Knoll thinking she was a black woman championing the rights of underserved people, like a Jessica Knoll I know. In that light, the world in which we support one another, her writing is surprising, refreshing and a self aware counterpoint about the role of money in the US. <br/><br/>The righteous liberal comments (and Iâm a lefty liberal) seem off key. Build one another up. Let her have success.<br/><br/>Iâd love to live in a world where women, of any color, were so successful it was commonplace, and weâd shrug at their fixers. "
6050,OpEd,"Wow. This spoke to me, and I so needed to hear it while facing a big decision in my life path. I am a writer and lawyer who relocated from Arkansas to SoCal, carrying big goals with me. I wrote my first sci fi novel a few years ago, and walked away from writing to focus on law. I am preparing to publish more this year. I always felt I had to bury my ambition so as not to come off too strong and offend people, causing them to question who I think I am. It's a question that made me second-guess myself and undermine my worth. As a result, I shrank myself and tried to fit, or bury my goofy, quirky, creative personality, so I could seem ""cooler"" or ""more chill"". This piece was not only refreshingly relatable, but helped give me the motivation I need in my big decision. I will definitely reach out to this writer."
6051,OpEd,"Well, It's a relief to hear a woman just say this out loud.  <br/><br/>Consider the months (hmm,make that years-) of Hillary Clinton's catch 22: trying to win power while also trying to look like she wasn't ""power hungry"" ( cold, a shrew, a b --ch ).  <br/><br/>Note: yours is NOT the first generation of women to feel that they were supposed to do everything well without - god forbid - offending anyone.  But the doors have been opened wider, and the choices are greater.<br/><br/>As someone who went into a traditional ""women's"" career, because of a devotion to the idea that ""helping people""  was the reason to be - I have to say that It dawned on me very late that ""helping "" might be more effective if I had made money with which to fund worthy projects or people. And have more control over my own life. <br/><br/>I'd love to understand more about how you were so determined so early.  How did you develop an unshakable belief in your abilities and worth?  <br/><br/>As you probably know,there's a body of psychological work that points to girls - even ones<br/> who seemed highly motivated, with distinct interests and personal goals - abandoning their most personal dreams around the time they hit puberty. That may be about being accepted, but the underlying reason may be that they accurately perceive real antagonism directed at them for ""standing out."" <br/><br/>This isn't solely about pursuit of material success,<br/>but about unapologetically following your dreams, and redefining success on your own terms. "
6052,OpEd,"Many of the comments here are in fact saying exactly what you are saying.  But you're all wrong.  Some people may have this double standard, but many others find similar sentiments by men equally ""crass."""
6053,OpEd,"ââQueerâ includes everybody,â<br/><br/>Not I. I reject the word. I prefer to be called ""homosexual"" if anything. That and ""LGBT"" are like nails on a chalkboard. The so-called culture of an urban ghetto was never to my liking. Those personifications made my coming out harder. I'm a country homo. And yes, I don't want that past world back."
6054,Games,"This one broke my streak, partially because I decided to churn through 8 of the Women of Letters puzzles over third shift Sunday, rather than continue to bang my head on this stumper. Finally finished Tuesday."
6055,Games,"For once, the theme became obvious to me as soon as I had filled in WATER CLOSET FIELDS, probably because ""The Bank Dick"" is still one of my most favorite movies.  I first saw it as a teenager, almost 80 years ago, and I laughed nonstop through the entire film.  WATER CLOSET is a truly apt choice for the meaning of Mr. Fields' initials.<br/>Thanks, Mr. Wentz, for the memory."
6056,Games,Began this puzzle last night knowing I wouldn't finish it before bedtime. I came to a complete halt with about half filled in. Then this morning I returned to it. Looked at 1a and filled in the blanks. Looked at the next open space and filled in the blanks. And so it went. Made me think of audreylm's comment yesterday about taking breaks during solving and returning with a fresh outlook. <br/><br/>My favorite theme answer was the WC FIELDS one; I responded with an out loud chuckle laugh. I'm still reeling though over the whole antemeridian ANTE MERIDIEM information. 
6057,Games,"I loved this.  What a complete solving experience!  Cracking vague clues, smiling at clever clues (RYE, STATUE, ITALIC, SIRS).  Huge aha at finally getting a theme answer well into the solve, then glee at successfully attacking others right away.  Placing in a slew of lovely words (SIT WELL, WAFTED, PILAFS, WHAMMY, COWL, JINN, WOODEN as clued, PELT, REMISS).<br/><br/>Then, afterward, noticing the food-loving crosses (FETISH/COOKIE, JOY/OMELET, MEATY/HAMM), and related word-pairs -- COMMIT and INSANE, WOODEN and STATUE, and ISAIAH and RUTH.  Plus the unrelated but somehow to me related ""S and M"" and"" P and A"".<br/><br/>It's clear that Peter took much care in crafting the grid and clues.<br/><br/>Great theme idea, using unrelated abbreviations, and a great overall solving experience.  IMO, a Sunday feast, and I'm sated.  Thank you Peter!"
6058,Games,"Wow - A.M. really doesn't stand for ""ante meridian"".  Turns out that ""ante meridiem,"" two words, is where the abbreviation comes from.  ""Antemeridian"" one word, means something closely related, but different.   That's some fine edutainment for a Sunday crossword!<br/><br/>I didn't get the theme until I had the whole puzzle done.  Well, maybe I was still trying to figure out how to deal with ante meridian and esa, and who the heck Dr. Nom was.<br/><br/>I agree with folks questioning P.C. Lab.  I've never heard that term - of course when I was studying computer science back in the 70s at Texas A&amp;M, our ""computer lab"" consisted of a room full of IBM keypunch machines and a card reader."
6059,Games,"I agree with David. All of the phrase meanings that the theme entries are based on, (W.C. Fields, PT boat, AP news, PC lab,  and P.S. I love you) have absolutely nothing to do with the definition. So why should AM (amplitude modulation) radio have to have an accurate relationship to the clue? Each of the initialled phrases, including AM radio is a ""thing"". That is all that matters as regards this theme."

6065,Business,"What I see, is the GOP and conservatives in general, getting in an offended uproar, when they should be used to it, since their president is the main purveyor of offensive tweets.  <br/><br/>It's not so funny when they are the target, or when they are in the forefront and when they have become is fodder for comedians.  Trump didn't want to go, because he's not funny, ever (excluding his fake tan) that's funny. <br/><br/>So if those who support Trump are upset, well to that I say, the truth must hurt, even when someone tries to make it funny. "
6066,Business,"Humour for a humourless administration. <br/><br/>Why is it that those with the most prejudiced of agendas, most divisive of thoughts canât take a joke. <br/><br/>If they werenât so aware of their horrible, one-sided intentions they might have time to laugh. <br/><br/>But then, they wouldnât be so horrible. <br/><br/>Itâs comedy. It was made it personal when the administration stopped caring about its fellow man. <br/><br/>If anything, the fact the Republicans canât laugh only makes this easier. "
6067,Business,"It was a roast, the jokes are supposed to be harsh.  Contrary to what ""journalist"" Brian Kilmeade said, I found Ms. Wolf's routine funny.  I did not understand Mika B's complaint that a ""wife and mother"" was ""humiliated on national television for her looks.""  I did not hear any insults of Sarah's looks plus Sarah was not roasted for being a wife and mother, she was roasted for her professional position.  For all of these women crying that Sarah is owed an apology, an apology for what?  Do women want to be equal or not?  You can't demand to hold the same positions and responsibilities as men and at the same time, demand to be placed on the ""wife and mother"" delicate pedestal.  Pick a side and stick to it."

6072,Business,"To the NYTimes: Donald Trump isn't going to like you anyway, so please stop acting all outraged on his behalf. Or on the behalf of his spokesmonster. Or whatever."
6073,Business,"Cue the false outrage.<br/><br/>Michelle Wolf is a great comedian, and if anyone had taken the time to research her performances they would have discovered that she is challenging and controversial. Good comedy usually is.<br/><br/>And, bless their hearts, Conway and Sanders should not have been surprised to be made the butt of jokes at this event. Conway's reaction was hilarious. She looked as if she wanted her superpower to be lightning bolts she could whip at Wolf. <br/><br/>Sanders was stoic, and deserves praise for sitting there and taking it, rather than huffing and puffing and storming out like some self-righteous lawmakers apparently did.<br/><br/>And contrary to one prevailing narrative, Wolf did not mock anyone's looks. She mocked their behaviour. Those who interpret what she said as an attack on Sanders' looks need to look inside themselves and try to understand what it is about Sanders that made them think that."
6074,Business,Maggie Haberman's comment--jumping to Sanders defense and falsely claiming that Wolf attacked Ms. Sanders looks-made me lose some respect for both the NY Times and Haberman's professionalism.  Did Haberman jump to Sanders defense because Sanders is a source of information for her expose type articles on the White House?  Why did the NY Times in this article quote Andrea Mitchell and Mika but not Haberman's misreading of Wolf's comments?
6075,Business,"I think you should probably have a sense of humor before you start lecturing on humor. Immaculate grace? If by grace you mean lying every single day to the American people, then sure.

6084,Culture,"The concern is not really over being invaded by ""hipsters."" The concern is over the very real mass compulsory evictions that have been occurring on the East Side of Los Angeles for over two years now.  These evictions, not invading hipsters, are the primary driving force behind the changing culture of the neighborhood (and, of the huge spike in the homeless population).  The people who support the local businesses and culture are booted out en masse, and replaced by those who can afford triple the rent.  This eventually triples the rent on all the remaining businesses.  That, combined with the sudden displacement of their patrons forces the local businesses out soon after.  This is not happening ""over time"" -- this is happening Over Night.  Literally.  The truly sad thing is that the residents who have done the heavy lifting of caring for and improving the neighborhood do not reap the benefits of their hard work.  They're harshly kicked to the curb.<br/><br/>By closely observing the tidal wave of ""gentrification"" heading their way, Boyle Heights residents have wisely learned to work to protect their neighborhood from changing too quickly.  The goal is to do exactly what you suggest -- let the neighborhood change over time and not overnight."

My family instilled pride in my heritage that no one could detract from. Comedy to a certain extent plays off stereotypes. I have no less affection and respect for South Asians because of Apu.

6112,Editorial,"If you want examples of ""kicking down"" in the Simpsons then look to Ralph Wiggum (funny looking child with learning disability), Cletus (slack jawed yokel living in poverty with dozens of offspring), Herman the Vietnam vet amputee, and at least several others I won't bother listing. But like with Apu they're not done with mal-intent or else it just wouldn't be a popular show.<br/><br/>What's nice about Apu is he's just a regular guy in the community in a lot of episodes (actually much smarter and more reasonable than most characters). One episode he's the ice hockey coach, another he's in Homer's barbershop quartet, one episode is about him cheating on his wife, and sometimes he's just another guy at the bar or ballgame. "
6113,Editorial,"Of course, I'm sure Mr. Bajaj has no problem with the show's constant mockery of white people, men, Republicans, conservatives, corporatists, and Christians. Why does Apu have to go? There is nothing offensive about him, at least nothing that's any more offensive than Ned Flanders, who for years has been the show's way of making fun of white, American Christians. And all that stuff about Indian representation on TV is silly. This is the United States, not India. It's not the show's fault that Indian-Americans are only 1% of the country's population. <br/><br/>The show has been declining in quality for almost two decades, but if Apu goes then they should just end it completely. "
6114,Editorial,"So. Now what? Often times I see people of color demand this change or that change. Today, ""White privliage"" is the world they like to use since White folks are forbidden to disagree with it. Yet, here we are. Apu is now voiceless and the people from S.E. Asia should be content. Right? Yet, what is the end goal? A place where everything you see, read or hear is full of diversity? What if people don't want that? Numbers prove this is a fact, Are they racist? Do they just smile in agreement then vote for Trump or his kin when no one is looking? "
6115,Editorial,"Please note that in this program, which is a satire after all, everyone has an exaggerated voice.  Poor Barney, the sad drunk, Marge, with her raspy housewife caricature, Chief Whiggam who sounds like a man imitating Edward G. Robinson. . .poorly,  and don't forget Homer, the all American idiot.  What Apu knows, is that it his exaggerations that help make him beloved, and very American in this character driven comedy."
6116,Editorial,"I guess nobody bothered to click and read the link on blackface, which was invented and plead by whites in America to demean and ridicule blacks, slave and free, I America from 1830 through the 1940s. This gave poor whites (actually all whites) a racist sense of superiority that still causes white police to murder unarmed blacks almost 80 years later. Similarly, making fun of Apu's accent, dress, and mannerisms and lowly employment at a chain convenience store gives the white, ""American"" audience a pleasurable feeling of superiority. And this has gone on and on for 30 years! Enough already."
6117,Editorial,I am offended by Homer's stereotypical working class oafishness. Someone owes me an apology.
6118,Editorial,"I think the issue here, is not so much that, Apu is a caricature, but that he is virtually the only prominent Indian-American on TV and he's a cartoon. As an Italian-American I think I know how it feels. Although it's changing, it's still true that most most overtly Italian characters are portrayed as loud happy people that like to eat, or gangsters. Sometimes they're cops."

But hopefully, I'm wrong.  <br/><br/>We saw that Chuck has his OWN fixer a la The New Halls or Hall.

6135,Upshot,"Yes, âidle hands are the devils workâ, but as our society becomes increasingly individualistic, education serves as a useful institution to keep people busy and plugged into a social network and structured goals. I have no doubts that we should invest in our teachers and in curriculum design, but that said, my sense is that these studies are presented here to suggest that increasing school rigor is the best way to encourage proper development, when other alternatives are not considered. Humans are communal, and thatâs why family, religious, and communal life is so important to us. It seems to me that children who fall into delinquency often have disadvantage(s) in these areas, and school is a social experience where students work towards structured goals, so I wonder if that is why rigor has a negative correlate with productivity. If this really is the cause, then itâs worth noting that athletes, artists, thespians, and people who develop scouting skills and trade skills also probably have a lower rate of delinquency, but also would be less susceptible to the chronic stress and increased occurrences of anxiety that children seem exposed to now. <br/><br/>Should we improve the quality of our education? Yes. But should we improve the rigor of our education? Well the question is, is it just the community and structured goals that promote healthy development, and if so, can these effects be captured in other after school activities, where children are encouraged to grow creatively."
6136,Upshot,"There is no magic bullet. This approach might work in selective, affluent communities. But for inner city youth there needs to be better schools, housing, job opportunities, health care. etc. You can't reduce risky teenage behavior if the students don't have the tools; i.e., a good primary school education. Some juvenile offenders that I supervised at a probation camp could not read past  the third grade. Half could not tell time unless it was digital. I did have one ex gang kid who graduated from a top university in North Carolina. It turns out as a six year old he was bused from South Central L.A. to a primary school in Beverly Hills. When high schools look like prisons and teachers have to be offered a bonus for them to teach in the inner city, then something is wrong with the picture"
6137,Upshot,"Sensible.<br/>Education is fundamental for increased reasoning using scientific facts.<br/>Productive challenge reduces boredom and stimulates creative thought rather than slumping to vices or lowest common denominator.<br/>Incremental increasing academic rigor allows all student levels to build personal pride and standards.<br/><br/>Reminding kids that it is their future, utilizing opportunities and resources will allow them better choices in life."
6138,Upshot,"Speaking as a geezer (I graduated high school in '58), I don't understand today's kids.  I worked, close to full-time through high school (and late grade school as well).   It was simply understood that I had a duty to keep my grades up and help carry my share of family expenses.  I think the current generation has softer standards."
6139,Upshot,"Mechanized instruction with standardized testing is the current educational model, a natural outcome of a business-defined academy. Our core rationale for educational spending is to create human fodder at minimal expense for the corporations we all serve.<br/><br/>Schools are nothing more than widget factories, until we stop dehumanizing and start cherishing our nation's children the crisis will not end. Humans are not ""resources"" to be managed."
6140,Upshot,"I taught high school science for one year and gave up on the idea of teaching as a career.<br/>High school is too late to start imposing rigor. The students I was teaching lacked fundamental skills like basic math and writing. They hadnât had enough in elementary school and my attempts to teach chemistry were wasted.<br/>You canât do chemistry if you canât do math, and you canât write a lab report if you canât write a sentence.<br/>Start in pre-k. "
6141,Upshot,"anecdotally, my bright, happy 6 year old learns more, faster when we set the bar a little higher. We give her encouragement, expectations, and the tools to meet the expectations. The results we see are are more marked when the expectations seem just a little bit out of reach... this has proven true for her in her academic life as well as her dance training. She's happy, challenged, and increasingly self-motivated because she knows the rewards come from her own hard work (at this age still heavily supported by parents and teachers/coaches). "
6142,Upshot,What is left out of this research is students with mental health and learning differences. The requirements for students with special needs are never taken into consideration into these studies leaving them further and further at-risk 
6143,Upshot,"These problems will never be solved while exhausted, underpaid teachers are rewarded/blamed for scores on tests mandated by a politically motivated hierarchy  from the White House down to the school principal and have no time to read, develop their personal talents and gifts, relax and reflect. Moreover, no one on the political side argues for developing a student's ability to think independently because of exposure to a well rounded curriculum which includes research, reading, writing skills, debate and art. Do we make students feel like robots who have nothing to say about their search for a meaningful life? Have we listened closely to their stories?"
6144,Upshot,"if children are not taught to do hard things when they are small, they will not have the capacity to do hard things when they are big.  My children didn't particularly enjoy practicing violin at age 5, but it taught them they could do hard things. When they were 7,  they did 7-year-old hard things and then12-year-old hard things, etc.  Fast forward to now:  One is a gifted secondary school math teacher and the older is just finishing the second year of medical school.  They both had full-ride scholarships.  Was there a price socially? Yes--it kept them away from non-forward-thinking friends and lined them up with life-long friends who continue to inspire and motivate them. Our children are happy, kind, hard-working, and generous. They will be the first to tell you that setting the stage early when they were small and continuing to be lovingly involved even now is the key. I believe we get what we expect, for the most part, with our children. "
6145,Upshot,"1993-2011?  there are far too many confounders, large societal and economic changes occuring during that period, for me to find the small effect-sizes in this study convincing.  I was reminded of this last night, watching Michael Douglas in Disclosure (1993) where he was a high tech (for the time) engineer looking to head the CD ROM division of a tech firm.  Tucked in shirt tails, flat screen CRT monitors (Sony Trinitron?), big blown up hair.. But the theme of the movie was also sexual harassment in the workplace, so maybe things haven't changed so much."
6146,Upshot,We are confronted with the push to defund all public education and have only charter schools or home schools so that the children can learn to read their christian bibles but not think or reason. They need to be brainless worker bees in a country with fewer and fewer thoughtless  jobs. If they could think or reason they would realize that a very small group of people is destroying not just their futures but the entire country in order to get rid of the new deal and every social safety net.
6147,Upshot,"I too had a rigorous but homework free experience.  What I see is that my children's Regent's homework and AP classes all feature massive amounts of make up work...make up for the weak academics of the prior fully included classrooms.  Yes indeed, homeschool and private school have a great future, as does the public library.  No need for our grandchildren to go to a 'school' that pretends it includes all students' academic needs while it benches them. "
6148,Upshot,"It seems they also considered this issue, since they evaluated long-term behavior. I will try to read the original paper, since I am a teacher as well and my school is considered a tough one."
6149,Upshot,"Basic statistics 101: Correlation is not causation. Many of the connections or linkages cite in this article could be due to a variety of other factors.<br/><br/>Further, what do you think increasing academic rigor will do for drop-out/fail-out rates for students who are already performing poorly in class and on tests? Many urban schools or schools with high percentages of minorities already have very high drop-out/fail-out rates because the students cannot read or do math at grade-appropriate levels, so increasing academic rigor will make under-performing students do even more poorly and inevitably push more of them out of school before graduation.<br/><br/>I would worry more about--and focus more on--under-performing students and how to improve them academically than about risky teenage behavior, which has always been with us and always will be. One need only look at the problems of high-performing schools to know that risky behavior is not limited to students of low economic status and poor academic performance.<br/><br/>And how about including unwed pregnancy in the list of risky teenage behaviors? That certainly adversely affects the lives of both the mothers and their children."

6154,Upshot,"@Sharon: My son, who just graduated last year, told me that all of the high schools in our town have substance abuse problems of one kind or another. At the STEM schools the kids are on Adderall and Ritalin, so it doesn't look like substance abuse. But these kids are not getting through these courses on healthy food and lots of sleep and exercise. They are taking drugs, and have become adept at hiding it. Cocaine is making a comeback in wealthy suburban schools, where the pressure to excel is intense. Kids smoke pot and ingest THC to relieve the pressure. Many cut themselves in places where the wounds won't be seen. The higher the expectations, the worse the anxiety. Those high-achieving students are paying a high physical and pyschic price and setting themselves up for breakdowns and problems in adulthood. Remember the article a few months ago in this paper about high-achieving professionals struggling with heroin addiction? "

6157,Upshot,"No it won't. It will increase the dropout rate.<br/><br/>How about delivering appropriate programming to these students so that they're not disruptive? They certainly have responsibility for their behavior, but they are not being appropriately served by the educational system. "

6164,Learning,"In the picture it looks like student part of some private school. To me it looks like theyâre doing the haka, the students look like they are singing some type of song. I think theyâre going the haka because their faces are aggressive looking and if youâve watched or seen videos of this dance they try to intimidate their opponent with their facial expression and movements."
6165,Learning,"It seems as if a private school is having some sort of celebration. They aren't angry or sad, so I don't think it is a rally or protest. "
6166,Learning,It looks like they could be protesting for something
6167,Learning,This picture looks like it is an all boys school. The boys looks like they are playing a game with each other.
6168,Learning,Everyone in the picture looks like there very passionate about something and they arenât holding tall long sticks with feathers. They are all wearing nice suits and they are running. It looks like some kind of march or protest.

6171,Learning,The school is going to pick up trash  with the stick and whoever picks up the most trash  gets a reward.The school is trying to give back to the community by helping the ecosystem.They are in a big city because there is a building in the back.They are excited because it is the end of the day and they are going to find out who won.
6172,Learning,The people are at a public school and they are in a play and they have to act like they're crazy and every single person has a role and as props they have to use like staff

6175,Learning,I think that this picture is from a simulation of a type of war or a strike because of the faces and expressions of the people. Also because of their uniforms. 
6176,Learning,In this picture it seems like the boys and girls may go to a private school because of their uniforms. The boys and girls are holding the items and making the faces they are because maybe they are going against their school for a reason. It may also be an event they hold at the school 
6177,Learning,"In this picture a group of teenagers are protesting. It looks like a pretty rural background and they look like college students because they're wearing uniforms. They look really happy and are making silly faces. Some of them look like they might be from Native American descendants which is why I think they're protesting for Native American rights or for the government to give them back their lands or just to show that they are there, that they exist, and that they are happy and willing to protest pacifically. "
6178,Learning,"I think the people that are wearing a white shirt, green tie, and the green shirt are maybe like a leader or something. The sticks kinda look like something the Native Americans would use and I say this because Native Americans loves feathers and they kinda have a cool design on the sticks. All the ladies and genital-men are making really weird faces  and like making fists."
6179,Learning,"In this picture it appears that these people are at a riot, or some school event. In this photo you can tell they're outside and it looks like they could possibly be walking out from the building behind them. They're also holding up sticks; some have red uniforms, and some have teal uniforms. "
6180,Learning,"I see very, very, very many people that are happy or scared with spears or poles in front of a giant building. Are they doing something like a Haka for fallen people  or just wanting to stand there?I honestly think it is a Haka."
6181,Learning,it looks like in this picture that maybe  group of college students are graduating from what school they go to. Or they could have made a chant sort of like the haka and have different facial expressions. And are celebrating the life of a student that went there.
6182,Learning,i thank they are having a play reenactment of the Indians are something i don't no maybe they are graduating or getting out of school? 
6183,Learning,i think that they are maybe doing weird stuff. They look in the ade groups between 7 and 30. I think that they are going to play a game of hitting other people
6184,Learning,I believe this could some sort of protest but the faces of the people look too goofy. So this leads me to believe that this might be same sort of holiday. I think this moght be something that a college does because most of the kids look around college age
6185,Learning,This looks like students in New Zealand. I assume they are learning how to protest for their curriculum. 
6186,Learning,The students look like they are reenacting harry potter. i not to sure why but they all look very dumb they look like they are purposely trying to look stupid.
6187,Learning,"This photograph looks as if a school or group of students are at a form of rally or game. Their facial expressions and excitement make it seem as if it is the said ""game/rally."" In addition, they are also in a large crowd and are holding up large poles, which could be dedicated to the game. "
6188,Learning,"@BR@N Thank you for your comment!<br/><br/>Like many of our comments earlier you are also thinking that this could be a protest. You are slightly changing that idea by saying that it could be a recreation of  an event like a protest. Looking into the background, you are wondering about where this might be taking place. <br/><br/>What do you see that makes you say that this a recreation of an event or protest?"
6189,Learning,I disagree
6190,OpEd,"Call the motive what you will -- sexual frustration, exclusion, defeat, anger. It all comes down to a sense of male entitlement and a violent display of power to reclaim it."
6191,Metro,"These officers would be far more useful enforcing quality of life laws such as speeding, horn-blowing and walking a husband off his leash. "
6192,Well,"I feel the same loss. By the time I was 30 years of age, lost both parents to rare cancers; my father at 60 and my mother at 65, all within six years of each other. And yes, you feel like an orphan when you go to weddings and see the father-daughter dance or the mother-son dance; when people wish you a happy mother's day or father's day; when you see how all of your cousins, for the most part, had their parents meet at least their first grandchild, if not attend their wedding. I won't pretend this is more horrible than losing a parent in childhood; but it is still painful and you really never get over your first two loves of your life, who are your parents. Their love is special and cannot compare to any other, in my opinion."
6193,Well,"I am an older orphan too. <br/><br/>I must say that I developed a better relationship with my parents after they died. While they were alive, I was mostly focused on maintaining boundaries with them, for to be around them was to be engulfed and overwhelmed in a very bad way. I could not be myself with them. The daughter they wanted and thought they had was not me. <br/><br/>Anyway, since they're gone, it's finally safe to have a few good memories and a few feelings about them. Just a few, but that's better than nothing...."
6194,Well,"So very touching. I miss my parents daily. It was heartening to hear someone else voice what I feel, and know that Iâm not being neurotic about missing my parents. I just do. I wonder if the desire, the need to call them ever goes away, or it stays like grief, a low level hum while the rest of life unfolds..."
6195,Well,"This paper ran a piece about a month ago on âElder Orphansâ, people who have no parents, siblings, children, or significant other. It was quite riveting. Their is a FB Page where one can become a member of the online group."
6196,Well,"I was 24 when my father died (age 66) and 45 when my mother died (age 85).  While I felt and still feel the loss of each of them, I never considered myself an orphan.  I truly believe that is a term reserved for the young who lost their parents through death, abandonment or any other reason.  To me, using the term âorphanâ to describe an adult who had parents and shared experiences (good or bad) takes away from the loss of those who missed out on so much.  If a title is needed, a new one should be created.  "
6197,Well,Beautiful!  Thank you for capturing my feelings as a long time orphan though I am now in my eighties.

That is all to the good, but it is also has me worried.<br/><br/>Prime Ministers of Israel-- an endangered country if there ever was one -- have little choice but to seek the support and approval of American Presidents regarding Israelâs peacemaking with the Palestinians; while remaining at all times completely supportive of the highest interests of the American people from whom so much crucial help is being received.<br/><br/>Which is why your relationship with President Trump is of the utmost importance.<br/><br/>A reality TV star with a well earned reputation for lying up his sleeves; a snake in the grass who achieved the Presidency without securing the votes of a majority of the American people; he is a man who is known to turn against his supporters and disregard his promises without a momentâs notice.<br/><br/>Please act accordingly and cunningly.<br/><br/>With great admiration and best thanks for your devoted efforts on behalf of Israel and the American people.<br/><br/>Stanton-in-Dallas"

In the U.S. it makes even more sense given the sheer amount of territory needed to be covered.   Plus, Sprint and T-Mobile face limited fiber providers for the terrestrial backhaul needed, unlike T/VZ with their big wireline businesses.   Is it really competition in wireless if AT&amp;T has wireless, wireline, international, DirecTV and soon Time Warner?    Or with Verizon with their wireless, wireline, FiOS, Internet businesses and dominant government services biz?  Sprint and T-Mobile each bring a wireless knife to an integrated communications gun fight.   Plus 5G is significantly more capital intensive with dense fiber and cell site networks.   Scale matters in this case.   The world changes and it would serve consumers and the country well if the DOJ and Obama cast offs got with the program.  The DOJ remains anchored to the correct notion that blocking AT&amp;T and T-Mobile was good for consumers.   However, this is a very different case (3+4) and the strongest case for competition in 5G, rural, business and government markets is through a stronger 3rd carrier in a business that is tremendously capital intensive.

6289,Well,Thank you so much for sharing this...I went to high school with Anna (then Luhrmann) and remember her as one of the sweetest people I've ever known. I'd been reading her books to my daughter and loving them for a couple of years before I realized that Anna Dewdney was the same person. I was very sad when I read of her passing and uplifted by the release of the Netflix animated adaptation of her work that released earlier this year. It was a lot of fun watching  Anna's work come to life with my little girl.
6290,BookReview,"Subtext is key, when listening to R&amp;H songs. Without it, ""Whistle a Happy Tune"" (for example) is treacle. When you realize Anna is actually terrified, despite her apparent expression of confidence, the genius of the song blooms. "
6291,BookReview,"I heard the music to this show many times, before I realized what it was about. Lt Cable fell in love with an island girl, but did not stay with her, because their prewar lives were too different. Nellie broke up with the older Emile, because he has been married, had kids, and those kids were half Polynesian. These altitudes seem perfectly normal in the prism of the 60s looking at the 40s. Like much great art, it is subversive."
6292,BookReview,"When music meant soaring Melody and Lyrics spoke to the uplifting of the human heart! Their musical creativity is something we will never see again! And haven't for the past thirty years or so! Additionally, as great as the music Rodgers wrote for Broadway musicals, his score for Victory at Sea, is equal, if at times even better, with the likes of Under The Southern Cross ( No Other Love Have I) and The Theme to The Fast Carriers!"
6293,BookReview,"I don't even like ""South Pacific,"" but that song is etched forever in my mind."
6294,Culture,"In the system for receiving, recording, and counting votes for the Tony awards, is there adequate protection against Russian interference?"
